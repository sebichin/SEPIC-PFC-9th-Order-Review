# ARCHIVE DIRECTORY

This directory contains files that were moved from the root directory to keep the project root clean and focused on essential documentation.

## Archive Organization

### `root_archive/` - Root Directory Archive
Contains files that were previously in the project root but are not essential for first-time review:

**Verification and Issue Tracking Documents:**
- `CITATION_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Citation verification across research documents
- `CITATION_CROSS_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` - Cross-reference verification
- `COMPREHENSIVE_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive validation report
- `FINAL_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Project completion summary
- `VERIFICATION_CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of corrections made

**Development Issue Documentation:**
- `GITHUB_ISSUE_HTML_TO_PDF_CONVERSION.md` - PDF conversion development notes
- `GITHUB_ISSUE_SLIDE_GENERATION.md` - Slide generation planning
- `ISSUE_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Issue resolution tracking

**Reference Images:**
- `VINUKUMAR-LUCKOSE-ICCE2022-corrected - V2.jpeg` - Circuit diagram (duplicate, original in `reference/`)

**Why Archived:**
These files contain valuable verification and development tracking information but are not necessary for initial project review. The essential verification information is summarized in:
- `README.md` (verification status)
- `MASTER_CONSOLIDATION.md` (complete verification details)
- `docs/verification_reports/FINAL_VERIFICATION_STATUS.md`

### `presentations_wip/presentations/` - Work-in-Progress Presentations
Contains older presentation PDFs that represent intermediate work:

- `v3_archive.pdf` - Earlier version (archived, superseded)
- `v4_CURRENT.pdf` - Previous version (superseded)

**Why Archived:**
These PDFs are work-in-progress versions that were superseded by the complete HTML slide deck and combined PDF in:
- `docs/presentation_slides/` (33+ professional HTML slides)
- `docs/presentation_slides/SEPIC_PFC_Complete_Presentation.pdf` (current, corrected version)

The archived presentations contain outdated equations (before October 2025 corrections) and incomplete content.

## Essential Root Files (Kept)

The project root now contains only 4 essential files for first-time reviewers:

1. **`README.md`** - Project overview, navigation guide, quick start
2. **`MASTER_CONSOLIDATION.md`** - Complete 40+ page reference document
3. **`STUDENT_GUIDE.md`** - Pedagogical guide with learning objectives
4. **`LECTURER_REVIEW_GUIDE.md`** - Specific guide for academic review

## Rationale for Clean Root

**Before:** 13 files in root (overwhelming for first-time viewers)  
**After:** 4 essential files in root (clear entry points)

**Benefits:**
✅ Clearer first impression for reviewers  
✅ Obvious where to start (4 files with clear names)  
✅ Reduced cognitive load  
✅ Professional organization  
✅ Historical content preserved in archive  

**Design Principle:** Root directory should contain only "start here" documentation. All supporting material organized in subdirectories.

## Archive History

**Created:** October 31, 2025  
**Reason:** Prepare clean lecturer review copy  
**Action:** Moved 9 files to `root_archive/`, moved `presentations/` folder to `presentations_wip/`

No content was deleted—everything is preserved for reference.

*This archive maintains project history while keeping the root directory focused and professional.*
