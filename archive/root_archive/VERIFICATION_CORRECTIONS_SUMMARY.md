## CRITICAL CORRECTIONS MADE

### 1. L5/L6 to D7/D8 Connections (FIXED)

**Error Identified:** Diode connections were swapped
- ❌ OLD: L5 → D7, L6 → D8
- ✅ NEW: L5 → D8, L6 → D7

**Source of Truth (From Paper):**
> "The phase 1 of the converter group consists of input inductor L2, L3, the capacitor C1, C2, the diode D1, D2 the semiconductor switch S1 and the output inductor L5."
> 
> "The input inductor L1, L4, the capacitor C3, C4, the diode D3, D4 the semiconductor switch S2 and the output inductor L6 are the components in phase 2."

**Correct Phase Assignments:**
- **Phase 1**: L2, L3, C1||C2 (vC12), S1, **L5**, **D8**
- **Phase 2**: L1, L4, C3||C4 (vC34), S2, **L6**, **D7**

**Impact:** ALL 36 equations updated with correct output inductor paths

---

### 2. Capacitor Charging in Topology 11 (FIXED)

**Error Identified:** Capacitors incorrectly set to bypassed (= 0)
- ❌ OLD: `dvC12/dt = 0`, `dvC34/dt = 0`
- ✅ NEW: `dvC12/dt = (iL2+iL3)/C12`, `dvC34/dt = (iL1+iL4)/C34`

**User Confirmation:**
> "for equation 7 you are wrong... this is the correct one: dvC12/dt = (iL2 + iL3) / C12"
> "for equation 8 you are wrong... this is the correct one: dvC34/dt = (iL1 + iL4) / C34"

**Physical Justification:**
- In SEPIC topology, capacitors charge from input inductors
- Energy storage occurs in both inductors AND capacitors
- Capacitors are NOT bypassed when switches are ON

## EXAMPLE CORRECTION: Topology 10, Equation 15 (diL6/dt)

**Before (WRONG - had L6→D8):**
```
Circuit Path: C34 → L6 → D8 → C0  ❌ WRONG DIODE
KVL: vC34 = vL6 + vC0
diL6/dt = (vC34 - vC0) / L6
```

**After (CORRECT - L6→D7):**
```
Circuit Path: C34 → L6 → D7 → C0  ✅ CORRECT DIODE
KVL: vC34 = vL6 + vC0
diL6/dt = (vC34 - vC0) / L6
```

**Note:** Equation stayed same, but physical interpretation now correct!

---

## EXAMPLE CORRECTION: Topology 11, Equation 7 (dvC12/dt)

**Before (WRONG - set to 0):**
```
dvC12/dt = 0  (bypassed by S1)  ❌ WRONG INTERPRETATION
```

**After (CORRECT - charges):**
```
KCL at C12: iC12 = iL2 + iL3 - iL5
In Topology 11: iL5 = 0 (isolated)
dvC12/dt = (iL2 + iL3) / C12  ✅ CORRECT
```

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Capacitor accumulates charge from input inductors
- Stores energy for later transfer via L5
- Not bypassed - energy storage element
