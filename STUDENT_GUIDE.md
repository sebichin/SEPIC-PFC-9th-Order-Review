# Part I: Foundations

## Chapter 1: Power Electronics Fundamentals (Week 1)

### 1.1 Why Power Factor Correction?

**The Problem: Poor Power Quality**

Traditional electronic devices (TVs, computers, LED lights) with simple rectifier inputs draw non-sinusoidal current from the AC mains [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]. This non-linear load behavior creates several problems:

1. **Harmonic Distortion** - Non-sinusoidal currents with high harmonic content flow back into the power grid, causing power quality issues [Ref: IEEE Std 519-2022]
2. **Low Power Factor** - Phase displacement and harmonic distortion result in utilities needing to generate more apparent power than the real power delivered to loads [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]
3. **Equipment Stress** - Harmonic currents cause additional heating in transformers, cables, and distribution equipment due to skin effect and core losses [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]
4. **Regulatory Issues** - IEC 61000-3-2 standard establishes mandatory limits on harmonic current emissions for equipment drawing ≤ 16A per phase [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]

**The Solution: Power Factor Correction (PFC) Converters**

A PFC converter actively shapes the input current waveform to follow the input voltage, achieving near-sinusoidal current draw at unity power factor [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]. Benefits include:
- Power factor > 0.99 (approaching ideal resistive load behavior) [Ref: PFC Converter Component Design Research]
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) < 5% (well within IEC 61000-3-2 Class D limits) [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]
- Compliance with international electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards
- Reduced power distribution losses and improved grid capacity utilization
- Lower electricity costs due to power factor penalties avoidance [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]

**Real-World Impact (Typical Values):**
- A 1500W device without PFC: May draw 2000-2500VA from grid (power factor 0.6-0.75) [Ref: Typical values from PFC application literature]
- Same device with active PFC: Draws approximately 1515VA (power factor > 0.99) [Calculation: 1500W / 0.99 = 1515VA]

**Analogy:** PFC converts a pulsed, difficult-to-supply load into a smooth, continuous load that is easier for the power grid to deliver efficiently.

### 1.2 AC Power Fundamentals

The analysis of AC power systems requires understanding three distinct power quantities [Ref: IEEE Std 1459-2010, Power Factor Correction Standards Research]:

**Active Power (P) - "Real Work"**
- Measured in Watts (W)
- Power that performs useful work (mechanical work, heat generation, light emission) [Ref: IEEE Std 1459-2010]
- For sinusoidal voltage and current with phase angle φ: **P = V·I·cos(φ)** [Ref: Fundamental AC power theory]

**Reactive Power (Q) - "Inductive/Capacitive Energy Storage"**
- Measured in VAR (Volt-Ampere Reactive)
- Power oscillating between source and reactive elements (inductors and capacitors) without net energy transfer [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]
- Required for magnetic field establishment but does not perform useful work
- Formula: **Q = V·I·sin(φ)** [Ref: IEEE Std 1459-2010]

**Apparent Power (S) - "Total System Capacity Required"**
- Measured in VA (Volt-Amperes)
- Total power-handling capacity the utility must provide
- Relationship: **S = √(P² + Q²)** or **S = V·I** for sinusoidal waveforms [Ref: IEEE Std 1459-2010]

**Power Factor (PF)**
- Ratio of active power to apparent power: **PF = P/S = cos(φ)** [Ref: IEEE Std 1459-2010]
- Range: 0 to 1 (1 represents ideal resistive load with no reactive component)
- For non-sinusoidal waveforms, PF includes both displacement and distortion effects [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]
- Industry target: PF > 0.99 for premium equipment [Ref: PFC Converter Component Design Research]

**Hydraulic Flow Analogy:**
- Active Power ≈ Net water flow through turbine (performs mechanical work)
- Reactive Power ≈ Water oscillating in surge tanks (stored and released cyclically)
- Apparent Power ≈ Total pipe capacity required to handle bidirectional flow

[Practice Problem 1.1: For a device drawing 10A RMS at 120V with 20° phase shift, calculate PF.  
Solution: PF = cos(20°) = 0.940]

### 1.3 Harmonic Distortion

**Fourier Series Concept:**

Any periodic waveform can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoidal components at the fundamental frequency and integer multiples (harmonics) [Ref: Fourier Analysis, standard mathematical principle]. This mathematical tool is fundamental to power quality analysis:

```
i(t) = I₁·sin(ωt + φ₁) + I₃·sin(3ωt + φ₃) + I₅·sin(5ωt + φ₅) + ...
       ↑ fundamental      ↑ 3rd harmonic    ↑ 5th harmonic
```

**Total Harmonic Distortion (THD):**

THD quantifies the distortion of a waveform compared to a pure sinusoid [Ref: IEEE Std 519-2022]:

```
THD = √(I₂² + I₃² + I₄² + I₅² + ...) / I₁

where I₁ = RMS value of fundamental component
      I₂, I₃, ... = RMS values of harmonic components
```

**THD Classification [Ref: IEEE Std 519 recommended practice]:**
- Excellent (Premium equipment): THD < 5%
- Good (Commercial grade): THD < 10%
- Acceptable (Industrial): THD < 20%
- Poor (Non-compliant): THD > 20%

**Why Harmonics Matter:**

1. **Additional Heating:** Higher-frequency harmonic currents increase effective conductor resistance due to skin effect and proximity effect, causing excessive I²R losses and heating in transformers, cables, and distribution equipment [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]

2. **Resonance Conditions:** Harmonic frequencies may coincide with natural resonant frequencies of power system components (capacitor banks, cable inductance), potentially causing dangerous overvoltage conditions and equipment damage [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]

3. **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):** Harmonic currents radiate electromagnetic fields that interfere with communication systems and sensitive electronic equipment [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]

4. **Neutral Conductor Overloading:** In three-phase systems, triplen harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th) add arithmetically in the neutral conductor rather than canceling, potentially overloading the neutral beyond rated capacity [Ref: IEEE Std 1100-2005]

5. **Equipment Malfunction:** Harmonics cause torque pulsations in motors, zero-crossing detection errors in control circuits, transformer overheating, and metering inaccuracies [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]

**PFC Effect on Harmonic Distortion [Ref: PFC Converter Component Design Research]:**
- Uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier with capacitor filter: THD = 30-80% (depending on filter capacitance)
- Active PFC converter (boost or bridgeless topology): THD = 3-5% (compliant with IEC 61000-3-2 Class D)

[Practice Problems 1.2-1.5: Calculate THD for given current waveforms, analyze harmonic spectra]

### 1.4 IEC 61000-3-2 Standards

The **IEC 61000-3-2** standard establishes limits for harmonic current emissions from electrical and electronic equipment with input current ≤ 16 A per phase [Ref: IEC 61000-3-2:2018]. This international standard is mandatory in the European Union and adopted globally as a key electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirement.

**Equipment Classification [Ref: IEC 61000-3-2:2018, Section 5]:**
- **Class A:** Balanced three-phase equipment and general equipment not in other classes
- **Class B:** Portable tools and arc welding equipment  
- **Class C:** Lighting equipment including dimmers and LED drivers
- **Class D:** Personal computers, monitors, TV receivers, and similar equipment with active input power ≤ 600W

**Regulatory Limits for Class D Equipment [Ref: IEC 61000-3-2:2018, Table 3]:**

The limits are specified in mA per Watt of active input power:

| Harmonic Order (n) | Maximum Current (mA/W) | Example for 500W Device |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 3rd               | 2.30                   | 1.15 A                |
| 5th               | 1.14                   | 0.57 A                |
| 7th               | 0.77                   | 0.39 A                |
| 9th               | 0.40                   | 0.20 A                |
| 11th              | 0.33                   | 0.17 A                |
| 13th ≤ n ≤ 39     | 3.85/n                 | Decreasing with n     |

**Rationale for Standards [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]:**
- Prevent cumulative harmonic pollution degrading power quality across the electrical grid
- Ensure electromagnetic compatibility between equipment sharing distribution systems
- Reduce power system losses caused by harmonic currents (skin effect, core losses)
- Mandate use of active PFC or other harmonic mitigation techniques
- Protect utility infrastructure from excessive harmonic stress

**Global Adoption [Ref: Power Factor Correction Standards Research]:**
- **European Union:** Mandatory under CE marking Low Voltage Directive since 2001
- **United States:** Voluntary adoption but increasingly required in procurement specifications (Energy Star, federal contracts)
- **Asia-Pacific:** National equivalents adopted (GB/T in China, AS/NZS in Australia/New Zealand, KS in South Korea)
- **International:** Many countries reference IEC 61000-3-2 directly in national regulations

**Compliance Testing Methodology [Ref: IEC 61000-4-7:2002]:**
1. Use calibrated power quality analyzer capable of measuring harmonics up to 40th order
2. Operate device under specified load conditions (typically 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% rated power)
3. Measure steady-state harmonic current spectrum for each test condition
4. Compare measured harmonic currents against applicable Class limits
5. Document results in test report with equipment under test (EUT) specifications
6. Ensure compliance across full rated operating range

**Design Implication:** To meet Class D limits with THD < 5%, active PFC topology is typically required. Simple passive filtering or capacitor input rectifiers cannot achieve these stringent limits [Ref: PFC Converter Component Design Research].

## Chapter 2: Circuit Analysis Foundations (Week 1-2)

### 2.1 Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

**The Fundamental Principle:**

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), formulated by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1845 [Ref: Historical - Kirchhoff's Laws], states:

> **"The algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit equals zero."**

This law is a direct consequence of the conservative nature of the electrostatic field and the principle of energy conservation [Ref: KVL_KCL Circuit Analysis Research].

**Mathematical Form [Ref: Standard Circuit Theory]:**
```
Σ vᵢ = 0  (summation around any complete closed loop)
```

**Sign Convention [Ref: KVL_KCL Circuit Analysis Research]:**

When traversing a loop (direction chosen arbitrarily but must be consistent):
- **Voltage rise** (traversing from − to + terminal): Assign positive (+) sign
- **Voltage drop** (traversing from + to − terminal): Assign negative (−) sign

Alternative convention (equivalent):
- Voltage drops in direction of loop traversal: Positive
- Voltage rises opposite to loop traversal: Negative

**Physical Interpretation:** The sum of energy gained by a unit charge must equal the energy lost as it completes a closed path through the circuit. No net energy can be gained or lost in a complete cycle [Ref: Hayt & Buck, Engineering Electromagnetics].

**Example 1: Series R-L Circuit [Standard Circuit Analysis Example]**
```
Voltage source (Vin) → Resistor (vR) → Inductor (vL) → back to source

Applying KVL clockwise:
+Vin − vR − vL = 0

Rearranging:
Vin = vR + vL = iR + L(di/dt)

This is the governing differential equation for the RL circuit.
```

**Example 2: SEPIC Converter Loop Analysis [Ref: SEPIC Converter Fundamentals Research]**
```
During switch ON state, input loop:
Vin → L1 → (short through switch) → back to Vin

KVL: Vin = vL1
     vL1 = L1(diL1/dt) = Vin
     
Therefore: diL1/dt = Vin/L1

This describes the inductor current slope during switch ON state.
```

**Common Student Errors:**
1. Inconsistent sign convention when writing loop equations
2. Omitting voltage across components (e.g., wire resistance, diode forward drop)
3. Incorrect polarity for dependent/controlled voltage sources
4. Failing to account for time-varying voltages in inductors: v = L(di/dt)

[Practice Problems 2.1-2.10: Apply KVL to resistive networks, RL/RC circuits, and simple SMPS topologies]

### 2.2 Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

**The Fundamental Principle:**

Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) states [Ref: KVL_KCL Circuit Analysis Research]:

> **"The algebraic sum of all currents entering a node (junction) equals zero."**

Equivalently: "The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node."

This law is a statement of **charge conservation**—electric charge cannot accumulate at a node in a lumped-element circuit model [Ref: KVL_KCL Circuit Analysis Research].

**Mathematical Form [Ref: Standard Circuit Theory]:**
```
Σ iᵢ = 0  (at any node)

Or equivalently:
Σ i_in = Σ i_out
```

**Sign Convention [Ref: KVL_KCL Circuit Analysis Research]:**
- Currents **entering** the node: Assign positive (+) sign
- Currents **leaving** the node: Assign negative (−) sign
- (Alternative: reverse the signs, as long as consistent)

**Physical Basis:** In steady-state and quasi-static analysis, charge cannot accumulate at a point. Any charge entering a node must instantaneously leave through other branches [Ref: Hayt & Buck, Engineering Electromagnetics].

**Example 1: Three-Branch Node [Standard Circuit Example]**
```
At node A, three resistors meet:
- i1 = 5 A (entering node)
- i2 = 2 A (leaving node)
- i3 = ? (leaving node)

Applying KCL:
+i1 − i2 − i3 = 0
5A − 2A − i3 = 0
i3 = 3A (leaving node)
```

**Example 2: Capacitor Node in Buck Converter [Ref: Switching Converter Transfer Function Research]**
```
At the output capacitor node:
- Inductor current iL enters the node
- Load current iLoad leaves the node
- Capacitor current iC may enter or leave

Applying KCL:
iL = iLoad + iC

Since iC = C(dvC/dt), we can write:
iL = iLoad + C(dvC/dt)

Solving for capacitor voltage dynamics:
dvC/dt = (iL − iLoad) / C

This is the fundamental equation for output voltage dynamics in DC-DC converters.
```

**Application in State-Space Derivation [Ref: State-Space Averaging for SMPS]:**

When deriving state-space models for switched-mode power supplies:
1. Identify all capacitor nodes in the circuit
2. For each capacitor, apply KCL to express the sum of currents entering/leaving
3. Use the capacitor constitutive relation: iC = C(dvC/dt)
4. Solve for dvC/dt in terms of other state variables (inductor currents, other capacitor voltages)
5. This yields the differential equation for that capacitor voltage

**Common Student Errors:**
1. Inconsistent sign convention (mixing "entering" and "leaving" conventions)
2. Forgetting that capacitor current iC can be positive or negative depending on charging/discharging
3. Neglecting parasitic currents (leakage, control circuit consumption)
4. Confusing node analysis with mesh analysis (KCL vs. KVL)

[Practice Problems 2.11-2.20: Apply KCL to various node configurations, derive capacitor voltage equations for converter topologies]

**Analogy:** Water pipe junction
- Total water in = Total water out
- Can't accumulate (incompressible flow)

**Mathematical Form:**
```
Σ i_in = Σ i_out

or equivalently:

Σ i = 0  (with sign convention)
```

**Sign Convention:**
- Current entering node: Positive (+)
- Current leaving node: Negative (-)

**Example 1: Simple Parallel Circuit**
```
Current source (10A) splits into:
- R1 branch (6A)
- R2 branch (4A)

KCL at junction: 10A - 6A - 4A = 0 ✓
```

**Example 2: Capacitor Node**
```
At capacitor positive terminal:
Currents: iL1 (in), iL2 (in), iC (out), iLoad (out)

KCL: iL1 + iL2 = iC + iLoad
     iL1 + iL2 = C(dvC/dt) + iLoad
```

[Practice Problems 2.11-2.20: Apply KCL to various circuits]

### 2.3 Component Voltage-Current Relationships

**Resistor (Ohm's Law):**
```
v = iR  or  i = v/R

Power dissipated: p = vi = i²R = v²/R
```
- Linear relationship
- Instantaneous (no memory)
- Energy dissipated as heat

**Inductor (Faraday's Law):**
```
v = L(di/dt)

Solving for derivative:
di/dt = v/L
```
- Voltage proportional to rate of current change
- Opposes rapid current changes ("current inertia")
- Stores magnetic energy: E = ½Li²
- Has memory (current is integral of past voltages)

**Physical Intuition:**
- Large L: Resists current change strongly (like heavy flywheel)
- Small L: Allows rapid current change (like light flywheel)
- v=0: Current constant (coasting)
- v>0: Current increasing (accelerating)
- v<0: Current decreasing (braking)

**Capacitor:**
```
i = C(dv/dt)

Solving for derivative:
dv/dt = i/C
```
- Current proportional to rate of voltage change
- Opposes rapid voltage changes ("voltage inertia")
- Stores electric energy: E = ½Cv²
- Has memory (voltage is integral of past currents)

**Physical Intuition:**
- Large C: Resists voltage change strongly (like large water tank)
- Small C: Allows rapid voltage change (like small cup)
- i=0: Voltage constant (static)
- i>0: Voltage increasing (charging)
- i<0: Voltage decreasing (discharging)

[Practice Problems 2.21-2.40: Calculate v, i, energy for various components]

### 2.4 Energy Storage Concept

**Why Inductors and Capacitors Are Special:**

Resistors: Energy in = Energy out (as heat) → NO MEMORY
Inductors/Capacitors: Store energy → HAVE MEMORY

**Energy Storage = State Variable**

For dynamic system analysis:
- Each independent energy storage element → 1 state variable
- Inductor: State = current (iL)
- Capacitor: State = voltage (vC)
- System order = Total number of state variables

**Example: RC Circuit**
- 1 capacitor → 1 state (vC) → 1st-order system
- Differential equation: C(dvC/dt) + vC/R = Vin/R
- Solution: vC(t) = Vfinal(1 - e^(-t/RC))

**Example: LC Circuit**
- 1 inductor + 1 capacitor → 2 states (iL, vC) → 2nd-order system
- Differential equations:
  ```
  L(diL/dt) = vC
  C(dvC/dt) = -iL
  ```
- Solution: Oscillates at ω = 1/√(LC)

**Key Insight:** System complexity scales with number of energy storage elements!

[Practice Problems 2.41-2.60: Identify state variables, determine system order]

### 2.5 Putting It Together: Circuit Analysis Procedure

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Identify all nodes and loops**
   - Label all nodes with voltages
   - Identify key loops for KVL

2. **Define current directions**
   - Choose arbitrarily (consistent sign convention)
   - Stick with choice throughout analysis

3. **Apply KVL to independent loops**
   - One equation per loop
   - Include all component voltages

4. **Apply KCL at nodes**
   - One equation per node (minus one reference)
   - Express currents through components

5. **Substitute component laws**
   - For L: v = L(di/dt)
   - For C: i = C(dv/dt)
   - For R: v = iR

6. **Solve for derivatives**
   - Isolate di/dt for inductors
   - Isolate dv/dt for capacitors
   - Result: State-space equations!

**Example: Simple RL Circuit**

Step 1: Circuit has Vin, L, R in series
Step 2: Current i flows clockwise
Step 3: KVL: Vin = vL + vR
Step 4: (Single loop, KCL trivial)
Step 5: Vin = L(di/dt) + iR
Step 6: di/dt = (Vin - iR)/L ✓

## Chapter 3: State-Space Fundamentals (Week 2)

### 3.1 What is a State Variable?

**Definition:**
A state variable is a quantity that:
1. Represents the "memory" of the system
2. Contains all information needed to predict future behavior
3. Corresponds to energy storage in the system

**Analogy: A Moving Car**
- States: Position (x) and velocity (v)
- To predict where car will be in 5 seconds, you need BOTH current position AND current velocity
- Just knowing position isn't enough!
- Just knowing velocity isn't enough!
- Together, they completely describe the system's "state"

**Circuit Context:**
- Inductor current (iL) = state (stores magnetic energy)
- Capacitor voltage (vC) = state (stores electric energy)
- Resistor voltage = NOT a state (no energy storage, can be calculated from other states)

### 3.2 State Vector

**Collecting All States:**
```
x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ]ᵀ

Example for RLC circuit:
x = [iL, vC]ᵀ
```

**Properties:**
- Column vector
- Dimension: n×1 (n = system order)
- Minimum set needed to describe system completely
- Changes over time: x(t)

### 3.3 State Equations

**General Form:**
```
ẋ = f(x, u)

where:
ẋ = dx/dt (derivative of state vector)
x = state vector
u = input vector (control)
f = function describing dynamics
```

**Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Form:**
```
ẋ = Ax + Bu

where:
A = state matrix (n×n)
B = input matrix (n×m)
x = state vector (n×1)
u = input vector (m×1)
```

**Example: RC Circuit**
```
State: x = vC
Input: u = Vin

Equation: C(dvC/dt) = (Vin - vC)/R

State-space form:
dvC/dt = -1/(RC)·vC + 1/(RC)·Vin

In matrix form:
ẋ = Ax + Bu
where A = -1/(RC), B = 1/(RC)
```

### 3.4 Why State-Space?

**Advantages over Transfer Functions:**

1. **Handles Multiple Inputs/Outputs**
   - Transfer function: SISO (single-input, single-output)
   - State-space: MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output)
   - Our system: 2 inputs (d1, d2), 9 outputs possible

2. **Time-Domain Analysis**
   - Direct solution: x(t) = e^(At)·x(0) + ∫e^(A(t-τ))·Bu(τ)dτ
   - No need for Laplace transform
   - Numerical simulation straightforward

3. **Nonlinear Systems**
   - Transfer functions only for linear systems
   - State-space handles nonlinear: ẋ = f(x, u)
   - Our CPL model is nonlinear!

4. **Computer Implementation**
   - Matrix operations → efficient algorithms
   - MATLAB/Simulink native format
   - Control design tools (LQR, Kalman filter)

5. **Physical Insight**
   - Each state has physical meaning
   - Can observe/measure states directly
   - Internal dynamics visible

### 3.5 Simple Examples

**Example 1: First-Order RC**
```
Circuit: Vin --R-- vC --C-- GND

KVL: Vin = iR + vC
KCL: i = C(dvC/dt)

Combine: C(dvC/dt) = (Vin - vC)/R

State-space:
ẋ = -1/(RC)·x + 1/(RC)·u
where x = vC, u = Vin

Solution (step response):
vC(t) = Vin(1 - e^(-t/τ))
where τ = RC (time constant)
```

**Example 2: Second-Order LC**
```
Circuit: Vin --L-- iL --C-- GND

States: x = [iL, vC]ᵀ

KVL: Vin = L(diL/dt) + vC
KCL: iL = C(dvC/dt)

State equations:
diL/dt = (Vin - vC)/L
dvC/dt = iL/C

Matrix form:
[diL/dt]   [  0    -1/L] [iL]   [1/L]
[dvC/dt] = [1/C     0  ] [vC] + [ 0 ] Vin

A = [0  -1/L]    B = [1/L]
    [1/C   0 ]        [ 0 ]
```

**Example 3: RLC (Second-Order with Damping)**
```
Circuit: Vin --L-- iL --R-- vC --C-- GND

States: x = [iL, vC]ᵀ

KVL: Vin = L(diL/dt) + iLR + vC
KCL: iL = C(dvC/dt)

State equations:
diL/dt = (Vin - iLR - vC)/L = -R/L·iL - 1/L·vC + 1/L·Vin
dvC/dt = iL/C

Matrix form:
[diL/dt]   [-R/L  -1/L] [iL]   [1/L]
[dvC/dt] = [1/C    0  ] [vC] + [ 0 ] Vin
```

### Important Disclaimers:

**On Numerical Examples:** Numerical values provided in pedagogical examples (e.g., "1500W device draws 2000VA without PFC") represent typical performance characteristics observed in industry but may vary with specific circuit implementations, component tolerances, and operating conditions. Always perform detailed analysis and simulation for actual design work.

**On Design Procedures:** Component sizing formulas and design equations are derived from standard power electronics theory and industry application notes. However, practical designs must account for:
- Component parasitics (ESR, ESL, core losses)
- Thermal management requirements
- EMI/EMC compliance
- Safety standards and regulatory requirements
- Manufacturing tolerances and reliability considerations

**On Safety:** This guide provides theoretical knowledge for educational purposes. Practical work with power electronics involves potentially lethal voltages and currents. Always follow proper safety procedures, use appropriate test equipment, and work under qualified supervision.

**On Software Implementation:** MATLAB code examples assume proper licensing and correct installation. Alternative tools (Octave, Python with SciPy) may be used but may require syntax adjustments. Always verify numerical results against analytical calculations.
