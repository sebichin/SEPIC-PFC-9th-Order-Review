## HOW TO REVIEW THIS PROJECT

### For Quick Assessment (10-15 minutes)
1. Read `README.md` (project overview)
2. Browse `docs/presentation_slides/index.html` (visual summary)
3. Check `matlab/` directory (code structure)
4. Review `VERIFICATION_CORRECTIONS_SUMMARY.md` (recent work)

### For Detailed Technical Review (1-2 hours)
1. Read `MASTER_CONSOLIDATION.md` (complete mathematical derivation)
2. Review `docs/detailed_analysis/COMPLETE_36_EQUATION_DERIVATION.md` (equation-by-equation)
3. Examine `matlab/build_per_topology_matrices_9th_order.m` (implementation)
4. Check presentation slides for pedagogical clarity
5. Review verification reports for methodology validation

### For Code Validation (Not Yet Executed)
**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This code has been written but not yet executed or validated.

**To review the code structure:**
1. Open MATLAB or Octave
2. Navigate to `matlab/` directory
3. Examine `build_per_topology_matrices_9th_order.m` (symbolic matrix construction)
4. Examine `phase3_avg_linearize_9th_order.m` (averaging and linearization logic)
5. Review code comments and structure for correctness

**For future validation (Phase 2):**
- Execute code with numerical values from paper
- Verify dimensions (should output 9√ó9 matrices, 9√ó1 vectors)
- Compare transfer functions with simulation results

### Suggested Review Questions
- Are the equations derived correctly from KVL/KCL?
- Is the 9th-order system justified (vs. simplified models)?
- Are the state-space matrices dimensionally consistent?
- Is the CPL modeling approach appropriate?
- Are the verification methods sound?
- Is the documentation clear and professional?
