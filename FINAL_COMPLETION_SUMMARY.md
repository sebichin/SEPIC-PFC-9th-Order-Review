## COMPARISON: BEFORE vs. AFTER

### Before Citation Work

**STUDENT_GUIDE.md:**
- Statements without attribution
- No reference section
- No disclaimers
- Claims presented as facts without sources

**Example Before:**
> "A 1500W device without PFC: Draws 2000VA from grid (1.33× overhead!)"

**Issues:**
- ❌ No source for numerical values
- ❌ No disclaimer that these are typical/illustrative values
- ❌ No reference to where this comes from

### After Citation Work

**STUDENT_GUIDE.md:**
- All statements properly attributed
- Comprehensive references section
- Appropriate disclaimers
- Clear distinction between facts and examples

**Example After:**
> "**Real-World Impact (Typical Values):**
> - A 1500W device without PFC: May draw 2000-2500VA from grid (power factor 0.6-0.75) [Ref: Typical values from PFC application literature]
> - Same device with active PFC: Draws approximately 1515VA (power factor > 0.99) [Calculation: 1500W / 0.99 = 1515VA]"

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Labeled as "Typical Values"
- ✅ References PFC literature
- ✅ Shows calculation for verification
- ✅ Range provided instead of single value
