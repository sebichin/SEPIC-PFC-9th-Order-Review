### GitHub Issue Title:

**Expand Presentation Slides for Educational Clarity and Detailed Context**

### GitHub Issue Description (Prompt):

**Objective:**

Transform the existing presentation (slides 11-15) from a high-level summary into a self-contained educational resource. The target audience is an undergraduate electrical engineering student who is familiar with basic circuit analysis but not with advanced power electronics topologies or state-space control theory.

The goal is to recursively research the project's core documentation and insert new, explanatory slides that bridge all conceptual gaps, making the material fully understandable without prior expertise in this specific converter.

**Core Source Documents:**

*   **Foundational Concepts:** `docs/Analysis_of_Standard_SEPIC_DC-DC_Converter_in_Continuous_Conduction_Mode_(CCM).md`
*   **Project-Specific Circuit Behavior:** `docs/detailed_analysis/CIRCUIT_TOPOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`
*   **Formal Mathematical Derivations:** `docs/detailed_analysis/COMPLETE_36_EQUATION_DERIVATION.md`

**Action Plan: Slide Expansion and Refactoring**

Modify and insert new slides to create a clear, step-by-step narrative. The new flow should be as follows:

---

**Part 1: From Standard SEPIC to Our 9th-Order System**

1.  **NEW SLIDE: "Introducing the Interleaved Bridgeless SEPIC PFC Converter"**
    *   **Content:** Display the full circuit diagram from `CIRCUIT_TOPOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`.
    *   **Explanation:**
        *   Define "Bridgeless," "Interleaved," and "PFC" in this context.
        *   Visually contrast it with the standard SEPIC to justify the increase in complexity.
        *   **Source:** `CIRCUIT_TOPOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`

2.  **NEW SLIDE: "Defining the System: The 9 State Variables"**
    *   **Content:** Use the circuit diagram again, but this time, highlight and label each of the 9 energy storage elements (L1-L6, C1, C3, C0).
    *   **Explanation:**
        *   Explain *why* these are the state variables (inductor currents and capacitor voltages cannot change instantaneously).
        *   List the state vector `x = [iL1, iL2, iL3, iL4, iL5, iL6, vC1, vC3, vC0]ᵀ` and explicitly link each variable to its component on the diagram.
        *   **Source:** `CIRCUIT_TOPOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`

3.  **MODIFY SLIDE 11: "State-Space Form: From Equations to Matrices"**
    *   **Content:**
        *   Keep the baseline comparison to a standard SEPIC.
        *   **Add a new section:** "Building a Matrix Row by Row (Example: dvC1/dt)".
        *   Show the KCL equation for the `vC1` node from the derivation document: `dvC1/dt = (1/C1) * iL2 - (1/C1) * iL5`.
        *   Visually map this equation to the 7th row of the `A_11` matrix, showing how the `iL2` and `iL5` terms become coefficients in the matrix.
        *   Present the final, corrected `A_11` and `B_11` matrices, ensuring they are 100% accurate to the `COMPLETE_36_EQUATION_DERIVATION.md`.
    *   **Source:** `COMPLETE_36_EQUATION_DERIVATION.md`

**Part 2: Demystifying State-Space Averaging**

4.  **MODIFY SLIDE 12: "Averaging Methodology"**
    *   **Content:**
        *   Strengthen the introduction by explaining *why* we average: "To analyze low-frequency control dynamics (like 50/60Hz line current) by 'smoothing out' the high-frequency switching ripple (50kHz)."
        *   Keep the comparison to classical 2-state averaging.
        *   When introducing the 4-topology weights, add a timing diagram that visually shows `d1`, `d2`, and the resulting `w_11`, `w_10`, `w_01`, `w_00` intervals for both overlapping and non-overlapping cases.

5.  **NEW SLIDE: "Physical Meaning of Each Topology (Example: Topology 11)"**
    *   **Content:** Use a simplified version of the circuit diagram showing the active current paths when both switches are ON.
    *   **Explanation:**
        *   Describe what is physically happening: "Energy is stored from the source into L1 and L2."
        *   "Simultaneously, C1 and C3 discharge into L5 and L6, 'reverse-charging' them in preparation for the next phase."
        *   "The output is isolated, and the load is supplied only by the output capacitor C0."
    *   **Source:** `CIRCUIT_TOPOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md`

**Part 3: Making Linearization Intuitive**

6.  **MODIFY SLIDE 13: "Linearization for Control Design"**
    *   **Content:**
        *   Add a conceptual introduction: "Why linearize? To use powerful linear control theory tools (like Bode plots and root locus) which require a linear model. We approximate the nonlinear system's behavior around a specific DC operating point."
        *   When introducing the CPL Jacobian term, explicitly show the chain rule: `∂f/∂x = ∂/∂x [A_avg·x + ... + f_CPL(x)]`.
        *   Show the step-by-step derivative of the CPL term `∂/∂vC0[-P/(C0·vC0)]` to make it clear where the positive, destabilizing term comes from.

7.  **NEW SLIDE: "What is a Transfer Function?"**
    *   **Content:** Provide a simple, intuitive definition.
    *   **Explanation:**
        *   "A transfer function `G(s) = Output(s) / Input(s)` is a compact mathematical model that tells us how a system responds to an input at different frequencies."
        *   "Example: `G_vd1(s) = ΔV_out(s) / Δd1(s)` tells us how much the output voltage will change for a small change in duty cycle `d1`."
        *   "We use these to design controllers (like PI controllers) that ensure stability and performance (e.g., fast response, no overshoot)."

**Part 4: Finalizing the Story**

8.  **MODIFY SLIDE 14 & 15: "Verification and Conclusions"**
    *   **Action:** Review and update these slides to ensure they accurately summarize the new, more detailed narrative.
    *   The "Code-Model Correspondence" checklist item on Slide 14 must be updated to confirm that the (now corrected) slide matrices match the formal derivation.
    *   The conclusions on Slide 15 should reflect the new conceptual journey, from basics to the advanced model.

By completing this task, the presentation will be transformed into a high-quality, standalone tutorial that is both technically accurate and pedagogically sound.
