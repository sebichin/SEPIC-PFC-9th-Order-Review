## **The Principle of Pulse-Width Modulation in Power Electronics**

### **Authoritative Definition and Principle of Operation**

Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is a foundational control technique employed across the spectrum of modern power electronics.1 Formally, PWM (also known as pulse-duration modulation) is a method of representing a continuous, often analog, control signal as a high-frequency rectangular wave, or pulse train, whose *duty cycle* is varied.3

The fundamental purpose of PWM in power electronics is to control the *average power*, *average voltage*, or *average current* delivered to a load.3 This approach stands in stark contrast to linear power control, where a control element (like a transistor) is operated in its active or linear region, continuously dissipating power as heat to regulate the output.4

The utility of PWM stems from its ability to leverage the high-efficiency nature of semiconductor switches, such as Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs). In power electronic converters, these switches are operated exclusively in one of two states: fully ON (saturation) or fully OFF (cutoff).6 This "switching mode" operation is highly efficient 5:

* **In the ON state:** The voltage drop across the switch ($V\_{DS}$) is minimal (ideally zero), resulting in low power loss ($P\_{loss} \= V\_{DS} \\times I\_{load}$) even with high current.  
* **In the OFF state:** The current ($I\_D$) flowing through the switch is zero, resulting in zero power loss ($P\_{loss} \= V\_{DS} \\times I\_D$).

Power loss is significant only during the brief transitions between these two states.5 PWM is the conceptual bridge that allows these binary (ON/OFF) switches to produce a precise, analog average output. By modulating the ON-time (the pulse width) relative to the total switching period, the average value of the output voltage is precisely controlled. The high-frequency switching noise is then removed by a passive low-pass filter (typically an inductor and capacitor), which recovers the desired DC or low-frequency average value.3

### **Realization of PWM: The Duty Cycle as a Control Input**

In practice, a PWM signal is most commonly generated by comparing a low-frequency analog *reference signal* ($v\_{ref}$) with a high-frequency *carrier signal* ($v\_{carrier}$).8 The reference signal is typically the output of a feedback error amplifier, representing the "control effort" needed to maintain the desired output voltage.9 The carrier is a fixed-frequency (at the switching frequency, $f\_{SW}$) sawtooth or triangular waveform.

The switch's gate signal is set high (ON) when $v\_{ref} \> v\_{carrier}$ and low (OFF) otherwise. This comparison directly translates the *amplitude* of the reference signal into the *time duration* (pulse width) of the switch. This relationship is defined by the *duty cycle* ($D$), the ratio of the switch's ON-time ($T\_{on}$) to the total switching period ($T\_s$), where $D \= T\_{on} / T\_s$. This mechanism is the "Pulse-Width Modulation Transfer Function" that links the analog control domain to the discrete-time power switching domain.9

### **Application in Canonical DC-DC Converters**

The duty cycle $D$ serves as the primary control input for the family of switch-mode DC-DC converters.10 Authoritative texts, such as those by Mohan et al. and Erickson and Maksimovic, define the ideal, steady-state voltage conversion ratios ($M \= V\_{out} / V\_{in}$) for the three fundamental topologies operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) as a direct function of $D$ 10:

* **Buck (Step-Down) Converter:** $M \= D$  
* **Boost (Step-Up) Converter:** $M \= \\frac{1}{1-D}$  
* **Buck-Boost (Inverting) Converter:** $M \= \-\\frac{D}{1-D}$

In an ideal CCM converter, the output voltage is independent of the load and is controlled solely by modulating the duty cycle $D$ via the PWM process.14

## **Analysis of Switching Frequency ($f\_{SW}$) for MOSFET Converters**

The selection of the operating *switching frequency* ($f\_{SW}$) is arguably the most critical optimization problem in power converter design. It represents a fundamental trade-off between the converter's physical size (volumetric density) and its thermal performance (efficiency).15

### **The Fundamental Trade-Off: Volumetric Density vs. Thermal Dissipation**

The primary motivation for increasing $f\_{SW}$ is to **reduce the physical size** and cost of the passive components—namely, the inductors and capacitors—which typically dominate the converter's volume and footprint.15

The fundamental limitation, however, is that increasing $f\_{SW}$ **proportionally increases switching losses**.15 These losses manifest as heat, which lowers overall conversion efficiency and creates a thermal management burden that can negate the benefits of the smaller size.17

### **Impact on Passive Component Sizing (The "Driver")**

The relationship between $f\_{SW}$ and component size is derived from the converter's steady-state principles.

* **Inductor (L) Sizing:** The inductor's value is selected to maintain a specific peak-to-peak ripple current ($\\Delta I\_L$). Based on the inductor volt-second balance equation, $V\_L \= L \\frac{di}{dt}$. For a buck converter during the switch ON-time ($T\_{on}$), this is $(V\_{in} \- V\_{out}) \\times T\_{on} \= L \\times \\Delta I\_L$. Because $T\_{on} \= \\frac{D}{f\_{SW}}$, this relationship can be rearranged to $L \= \\frac{(V\_{in} \- V\_{out}) \\times D}{\\Delta I\_L \\times f\_{SW}}$. This proves the key relationship: the required inductance ($L$) is **inversely proportional to the switching frequency ($f\_{SW}$)**.19 A higher $f\_{SW}$ requires a smaller $L$ for the same ripple, enabling a physically smaller magnetic component.19  
* **Capacitor (C) Sizing:** Similarly, the output capacitor's value is chosen to limit the output voltage ripple ($\\Delta V\_{out}$), which is a function of the inductor's ripple current charging and discharging the capacitor. The relationship is $\\Delta V\_{out} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta I\_L}{8 \\times C \\times f\_{SW}}$. This shows that the required capacitance ($C$) is also **inversely proportional to the switching frequency** for a given ripple voltage.24

The system-level result is that higher frequencies enable smaller, lighter, and often cheaper passive components, thus increasing power density.15

### **Quantification of Frequency-Dependent Power Losses (The "Limitation")**

The thermal limitation of high-frequency operation is defined by two primary categories of MOSFET power loss.

1. **Conduction Losses ($P\_{cond}$):** These "static losses" occur when the MOSFET is in the fully ON state, behaving as a resistor ($R\_{DS(on)}$).5 They are calculated as $P\_{cond} \= I\_{D,rms}^2 \\times R\_{DS(on)}$. Conduction losses are **independent of switching frequency** and are determined by the load current and the intrinsic resistance of the chosen device.7  
2. **Switching Losses ($P\_{SW}$):** These "dynamic losses" occur *only* during the finite turn-on and turn-off transitions.7 During these transitions, the MOSFET is in its linear region, and both voltage ($V\_{DS}$) and current ($I\_D$) are simultaneously non-zero, resulting in a brief, high-power dissipation spike.5 The *energy* lost during each transition ($E\_{sw}$) is a fixed property of the device and circuit. The total switching *power* loss is this energy multiplied by the number of transitions per second: $P\_{SW} \= E\_{sw} \\times f\_{SW}$.23

Key mechanisms of frequency-dependent switching loss in a MOSFET include 19:

* **Output Capacitance Loss:** Energy stored in the MOSFET's drain-to-source capacitance ($C\_{DS}$ or $C\_{OSS}$) is dissipated as heat each cycle. $P\_{SW,Coss} \= \\frac{1}{2} \\times C\_{DS} \\times V\_{DS}^2 \\times f\_{SW}$.  
* **Gate Drive Loss:** Power is required to charge and discharge the gate capacitance ($Q\_G$) every cycle. $P\_{GATE} \= Q\_G \\times V\_G \\times f\_{SW}$.  
* **Reverse-Recovery Loss:** In CCM converters, when the MOSFET turns on, it must "recover" the stored charge from the freewheeling diode, causing a large, brief current spike and significant loss, which also scales with $f\_{SW}$.19

This dynamic creates an optimization problem. As $f\_{SW}$ rises, conduction losses may fall (due to smaller, lower-DCR inductors), but switching losses rise linearly.22 The optimal $f\_{SW}$ is one that balances these two. A common design heuristic is to select a frequency where static (conduction) losses are approximately equal to dynamic (switching) losses.26

### **Secondary System-Level Implications**

* **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):** The high $dv/dt$ and $di/dt$ of switch-mode converters are significant sources of EMI.29 Increasing $f\_{SW}$ pushes the fundamental EMI harmonic to a higher frequency. This can be advantageous, as it allows for smaller and lighter EMI filters.19 However, it also increases the total radiated energy.17  
* **Control Loop Bandwidth:** A PWM converter is a sampled-data system, and its control loop bandwidth is fundamentally limited to a fraction of $f\_{SW}$ (e.g., $f\_{SW}/10$). A higher $f\_{SW}$ enables a **higher control bandwidth**, which allows the converter to respond much more **quickly to load transients** (e.g., a sudden change in load current), minimizing output voltage deviation.17

### **Contextualizing the 10kHz–100kHz Range**

While modern, low-power DC-DC converters for applications like microprocessors operate in the 500kHz to 4MHz range 32, the 10kHz–100kHz range specified in the query is highly relevant for a different class of applications.

* **The Lower Bound (Audible Noise):** Operation below 20kHz is typically avoided, as the physical vibration of magnetic components (inductors and transformers) at these frequencies can produce a highly undesirable *audible whistle*.34 A common lower bound is 25kHz.35  
* **The "Sweet Spot" (10kHz–100kHz):** This range is the domain of **high-power (kW-range) converters** and the battleground between Si-MOSFET and IGBT technologies.36 The reason for this lower frequency is the $P\_{SW,Coss} \= \\frac{1}{2} \\times C\_{DS} \\times V\_{DS}^2 \\times f\_{SW}$ equation.19 In high-power applications (e.g., a 400V motor drive or 400V power factor correction (PFC) circuit), the $V\_{DS}$ term is very large. The resulting $V\_{DS}^2$ term means that switching losses become dominant and severely limiting at much lower frequencies than in a 12V system.16  
  * **IGBTs** (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) offer low conduction losses at high voltage but are slow. They are the superior choice for high-current applications operating **below 20kHz–50kHz**, such as large motor drives or industrial robots.36  
  * **MOSFETs** offer much faster switching speeds and are dominant for frequencies **above 80kHz–100kHz** in applications like switching power supplies (SMPS), chargers, and small uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).36  
  * The **20kHz–80kHz** range is a "sweet spot" where designers trade off the low conduction loss of IGBTs against the smaller passive components (from higher $f\_{SW}$) and faster response of MOSFETs.36

## **Continuous (CCM) vs. Discontinuous (DCM) Conduction Modes**

The operation of a PWM converter is further classified by the behavior of the current in its main inductor ($i\_L(t)$). This leads to two primary modes: Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM).

### **Defining the Modes via Inductor Current ($i\_L(t)$)**

1. **Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM):**  
   * **Definition:** The inductor current, $i\_L(t)$, remains positive (greater than zero) for the *entire* switching cycle ($T\_s$).43  
   * **Waveform:** The current waveform is trapezoidal, consisting of a DC average current ($I\_L$) with a triangular ripple ($\\Delta i\_L$) superimposed on it.46  
   * **Condition:** This mode occurs when the average DC current is greater than the ripple amplitude: $I\_L \> \\frac{\\Delta i\_L}{2}$.46 This is characteristic of medium- to high-load operation.46  
2. **Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM):**  
   * **Definition:** The inductor current, $i\_L(t)$, falls to zero and *remains at zero* for a finite time interval within the switching cycle.43  
   * **Waveform:** The current waveform is a series of triangular pulses. It rises from zero, falls back to zero, and "rests" at zero until the next cycle begins.13  
   * **Condition:** This mode occurs when the average DC current is less than the ripple amplitude: $I\_L \< \\frac{\\Delta i\_L}{2}$.46 This is characteristic of light-load operation.46  
3. **Boundary Conduction Mode (BCM):** Also known as Critical Conduction Mode (CrCM), this is the special case exactly on the boundary, where the inductor current falls to zero *precisely* at the end of the switching cycle.45 The condition is $I\_L \= \\frac{\\Delta i\_L}{2}$.46

### **Analysis of the CCM-DCM Boundary Condition**

The transition between CCM and DCM is a load-dependent phenomenon. A designer selects $L$ and $f\_{SW}$, which (along with $V\_{in}$ and $V\_{out}$) *fixes* the inductor current ripple $\\Delta i\_L$.46 The *load* (represented by resistance $R$) determines the average DC current $I\_L$.46

At high load, $I\_L$ is large and the converter is in CCM. As the load decreases, $I\_L$ decreases, but $\\Delta i\_L$ remains constant. Inevitably, the load will become light enough that $I\_L$ drops below $\\frac{\\Delta i\_L}{2}$, and the converter *transitions* into DCM.46 Therefore, a converter designed for CCM at full load *must* be analyzed for its behavior in DCM at light load.

This relationship is formalized in authoritative texts like *Fundamentals of Power Electronics* by Erickson and Maksimovic, using a dimensionless parameter $K$.46

* **Definition:** $K \= \\frac{2L}{R \\times T\_s} \= \\frac{2L \\times f\_{SW}}{R}$  
* **Boundary:** The converter operates in DCM if $K \< K\_{crit}(D)$ and in CCM if $K \> K\_{crit}(D)$.46

The critical parameter $K\_{crit}(D)$ is a function only of the converter topology and its duty cycle $D$.

**Table 1: Critical Boundary Conditions ($K\_{crit}$) for DCM Operation**

| Converter | Critical Parameter Kcrit​(D) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Buck | $1 \- D$ |
| Boost | $D(1 \- D)^2$ |
| Buck-Boost | $(1 \- D)^2$ |
| Source: 46 |  |

### **Comparative Analysis of Steady-State Characteristics**

The two modes have radically different operating characteristics.

* **Conversion Ratio ($M$):**  
  * **CCM:** The conversion ratio is load-*independent* and a simple function of $D$ (e.g., $M \= D$ for Buck).13 This makes control simple.  
  * **DCM:** The conversion ratio becomes *highly load-dependent*, a function of $D$, $L$, $R$, and $f\_{SW}$ (i.e., $M \= f(D, K)$).14 When a CCM converter enters DCM at light load, its output voltage will *rise* significantly if the feedback loop does not correct the duty cycle.46  
* **Component Stresses (Currents):**  
  * **DCM:** For the *same average output power*, DCM operation results in significantly *higher* peak and Root-Mean-Square (RMS) currents in the MOSFET, inductor, and diode.47  
  * **Implication:** Higher RMS currents lead to much higher conduction losses ($P\_{cond} \\propto I\_{rms}^2$).47 Higher peak currents require higher-rated (and more expensive) components and increase turn-off switching losses.47  
* **Efficiency and Loss Mechanisms:**  
  * **DCM's Advantage:** DCM offers a major efficiency benefit: the *elimination of diode reverse-recovery loss*.43 Because the diode current naturally falls to zero *before* the MOSFET turns on, there is no stored charge to "recover." This also provides "soft" zero-current switching (ZCS) for the MOSFET, eliminating its turn-on loss.43  
  * **CCM's Disadvantage:** CCM suffers from both hard-switching turn-on losses and diode reverse-recovery losses.19  
  * **Conclusion:** DCM is often more efficient at *light loads* (where switching losses like $E\_{rr}$ dominate).43 CCM is more efficient at *high loads* (where conduction losses dominate, and DCM's high $I\_{rms}$ becomes a significant penalty).43  
* **Output Voltage Ripple:** DCM generally produces a *higher* output voltage ripple for a given output capacitor, as the current is delivered in short, high-peak pulses rather than a smoother trapezoidal flow.52

## **Advanced Analysis: Control Dynamics and System Stability**

The most profound differences between CCM and DCM are in their dynamic behavior, which dictates the complexity and performance of the control loop.

### **System Modeling: The Second-Order vs. First-Order System**

* **CCM (Conditionally Stable):** In CCM, the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) form a resonant L-C filter. Energy is stored in both components, and this "state" (inductor current and capacitor voltage) persists from one cycle to the next.57 This creates a *second-order system*.51 The control-to-output transfer function exhibits a two-pole response, which is *conditionally stable*.51 It introduces a 180° phase shift that can easily cause oscillation when a feedback loop is closed, and it *requires* a carefully designed compensation network.58  
* **DCM (Inherently Stable):** In DCM, the inductor current is *reset to zero* every cycle.43 The inductor's "memory" is erased, and its energy state does not persist. The system effectively loses a state variable, and its dynamics are no longer governed by the L-C resonance. The system behaves as a simple *first-order system*, dominated by the output capacitor and load ($R \\times C$).52 A first-order system is *inherently stable* and cannot oscillate on its own, making control trivial by comparison.51

### **The Right-Half-Plane Zero (RHPZ) in CCM Converters**

* **Definition:** The Right-Half-Plane Zero (RHPZ) is a notorious feature in the transfer function of certain converters. While a normal (left-half-plane) zero increases gain and *adds* phase (improving stability), an RHPZ increases gain but *removes* phase, acting like a pole in its phase response.47 This is a "non-minimum phase" response that is exceptionally difficult to control.  
* **Applicability:** The RHPZ appears *only* in converters with *indirect energy transfer* (notably the **Boost and Buck-Boost** topologies) and *only* when they operate in **CCM**.43 The Buck converter, which has direct energy transfer, does not have an RHPZ.51  
* **Physical Origin:** The RHPZ is the mathematical representation of a time delay. In a CCM Boost converter, energy is stored in the inductor when the switch is ON (time $D \\times T\_s$) and transferred to the load when the switch is OFF (time $(1-D)T\_s$).61 If the load suddenly increases, the feedback loop demands more power. To get it, the controller *increases* the duty cycle $D$. However, in that immediate cycle, increasing $D$ *decreases* the time $(1-D)T\_s$. This *shortens* the time available to transfer energy to the load. The output voltage *first sags* (gives less) when the controller *asked for more*. This "wrong-way" initial response is the physical manifestation of the RHPZ.62  
* **DCM Solution:** In DCM, the RHPZ is "pushed" to an extremely high frequency, effectively removing it from the control loop's concern.43 The "memoryless" nature of the inductor current (resetting to zero) prevents this non-minimum phase behavior.60

### **Control Loop Compensation and Dynamic Response**

* **CCM Compensation:** Control is *complex*.58 The designer must stabilize a second-order (or higher) system.51 In Boost/Buck-Boost converters, the RHPZ forces the designer to set the control loop bandwidth *well below* the RHPZ frequency to maintain phase margin and stability.47 This results in a *slow transient response*.52 Furthermore, CCM converters operating with $D \> 0.5$ can suffer from sub-harmonic oscillation, requiring an additional "slope compensation" circuit.43  
* **DCM Compensation:** Control is *simple*.43 The system is first-order and inherently stable.51 With no RHPZ to limit the loop, the bandwidth can be set much higher, resulting in a *fast transient response*.52

This creates a major design trade-off: **CCM offers high steady-state efficiency** (low $I\_{rms}$) at the cost of a **slow, complex, and conditionally stable control loop**. **DCM offers a simple, fast, and inherently stable control loop** at the cost of **low efficiency at high loads** (high $I\_{rms}$) and higher component stress. This is why some converters are *purposely designed to operate in DCM*: the designer has prioritized dynamic performance and simplicity over steady-state efficiency.46

## **Synthesis and Design Considerations**

The selection of switching frequency and the management of conduction modes are the two most interdependent design choices in a PWM converter. The choice of $f\_{SW}$ and $L$ sets the ripple current, which in turn defines the load $R$ at which the converter will transition from the high-efficiency, slow-control CCM to the low-efficiency, fast-control DCM.

A robust design must be stable and meet specifications in *both* modes.

### **Concluding Analysis and Future Trends**

The analysis confirms that the 10kHz–100kHz switching frequency range for Si-MOSFETs is a critical design space, primarily for high-voltage, high-power systems where the $V\_{DS}^2$ term makes switching losses a dominant limitation. The choice of operation within this band is a trade-off between the audible noise at the low end (\< 20kHz) and the mounting thermal challenges at the high end (\> 100kHz).

Furthermore, the choice of operating mode (CCM vs. DCM) is one of the most consequential in power electronics. The decision to design for CCM prioritizes high-load, steady-state efficiency at the cost of a slow and complex control system. Designing for DCM prioritizes a simple, stable, and fast-responding control loop at the cost of high component stress and poor high-load efficiency.

It is important to note that the advent of Wide-Bandgap (WBG) devices, such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) FETs, is rapidly changing these fundamental trade-offs.32 WBG devices exhibit significantly lower switching losses (lower $C\_{OSS}$ and $Q\_G$) and have zero reverse-recovery loss.16 This allows designers to "break" the classic Si-MOSFET compromise, achieving *both* high efficiency *and* very high switching frequencies (MHz+), pushing the next generation of power converters toward unprecedented power densities.16
