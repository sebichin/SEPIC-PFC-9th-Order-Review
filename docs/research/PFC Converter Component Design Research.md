## **Section 1: Analysis of PFC Architectures and Regulatory Mandates for 500W-2kW Systems**

### **1.1 The Regulatory Imperative: IEC 61000-3-2**

The requirement for Power Factor Correction (PFC) in modern AC-DC power supplies is not a design option but a mandatory prerequisite for regulatory compliance. Standard AC-DC converters, which use a diode bridge and a bulk capacitor, are non-linear loads. They draw current from the AC mains in short, high-amplitude pulses, which introduces significant Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and leads to a poor power factor (PF).1 Power factor is formally defined as the ratio of real power (measured in Watts) consumed by the load to the apparent power (measured in Volt-Amperes) drawn from the utility grid.3 A low power factor reduces the available power from the grid and causes electromagnetic interference (EMI) and cross-interference between systems.1

To combat this "harmonic pollution," regulatory bodies have implemented standards, most notably **IEC 61000-3-2**. This international standard sets strict limits on the amplitude of harmonic currents that equipment can inject back into the public supply system for all equipment with an input current up to 16 A.4

The standard defines four classes of equipment 7:

* **Class A:** Balanced three-phase equipment and all other equipment not falling into B, C, or D.  
* **Class B:** Portable tools.  
* **Class C:** Lighting equipment.  
* **Class D:** Equipment with a "special wave shape" (typically from a bridge rectifier and capacitor) and an active input power between 75 W and 600 W.

High-power (500W-2kW) supplies for servers, telecom rectifiers, and industrial systems typically fall under **Class A**.8 To meet these stringent harmonic limits, an active PFC circuit is required. The function of this active stage is to "shape" the input current, forcing it to follow the sinusoidal waveform of the input voltage, thereby making the entire power supply emulate a simple resistor from the perspective of the AC grid.1

### **1.2 Clarifying Component Terminology and Function**

The query regarding "input vs output filtering" inductors and "energy transfer vs DC link" capacitors highlights common points of confusion. An active PFC stage uses components for fundamentally different purposes. The following standard terminology will be used for this analysis.

**Inductors:**

* **"Input Filtering" Inductors:** These are passive components located in the EMI filter, *before* the active PFC converter.10 Their sole function is to attenuate high-frequency noise generated by the converter. These are subdivided into:  
  * **Differential-Mode (DM) Chokes:** Block noise traveling between the line and neutral wires.11  
  * **Common-Mode (CM) Chokes:** Block noise traveling on both line and neutral wires relative to earth ground.11  
* **"Energy Transfer" Inductor (Main Boost Inductor, $L\_{boost}$):** This is the large inductor *within* the boost converter topology. It is not an "output filter." It is the primary energy transfer element. It stores magnetic energy from the AC line when the main switch (MOSFET) is on and delivers this energy, along with the line energy, to the output when the switch is off.3

**Capacitors:**

* **"Energy Transfer" (Noise Filtering) Capacitors:** This terminology is imprecise. The components responsible for filtering high-frequency noise associated with the energy transfer process are the **EMI Filter Capacitors**, specifically **Class-X** and **Class-Y** safety capacitors.13 They do not transfer bulk energy; they shunt high-frequency noise away from the AC line, either to the neutral line (X-caps) or to earth ground (Y-caps).15  
* **"DC Link" Capacitor (Bulk Capacitor, $C\_{bulk}$):** This is the correct term for the large energy storage capacitor.10 It is located at the DC output of the PFC stage (typically a 400 VDC bus). Its primary functions are bulk energy storage to manage the low-frequency (100 Hz/120 Hz) power pulsation inherent in single-phase AC-DC conversion and to provide "holdup time" during brief AC line dropouts.16

### **1.3 Topological Selection for the 500W-2kW Power Range**

For power levels below 300 W, Critical Conduction Mode (CrCM)—also known as Transition Mode (TM) or Boundary Conduction Mode (BCM)—is a popular choice. Its advantage is that the MOSFET turns on at zero current, and the boost diode has zero current switching, which eliminates diode reverse-recovery losses.18 However, CrCM is unsuitable for high-power applications due to its variable switching frequency and extremely high peak currents (inductor ripple is 200% of the average).18

Dominance of Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM):  
For 500W to multi-kilowatt applications, Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) is the industry-standard operating mode.10 Its advantages are twofold:

1. **Fixed Frequency:** CCM operates at a constant switching frequency (e.g., 65 kHz or 100 kHz), which greatly simplifies the design of the EMI filter and magnetic components.10  
2. **Low Ripple Current:** The inductor current ripple is intentionally kept low, typically **20% to 40%** of the average current.18 This results in significantly lower peak and RMS currents compared to CrCM, which drastically reduces I²R conduction losses in the MOSFETs, diodes, inductors, and PCB traces.10

The primary challenge of CCM is "hard-switching." The boost diode experiences forced turn-off, which, in conventional silicon (Si) diodes, causes a large reverse-recovery charge (Qrr). This results in high switching losses and severe EMI.18 Consequently, an efficient high-power CCM design is contingent on the use of advanced diodes, specifically **Silicon Carbide (SiC) Schottky diodes**, which have near-zero Qrr and are essential for mitigating these losses.18

The Necessity of Interleaving:  
A single-phase CCM boost converter at 2 kW would place extreme thermal and electrical stress on its components.23 The standard solution is the two-phase interleaved boost PFC.25 This topology uses two boost converters in parallel, operating 180° out of phase.29 This architecture is the most important design decision in this power range, as it provides a cascade of critical benefits 25:

1. **Input Ripple Cancellation:** The high-frequency ripple currents from the two inductors are 180° out of phase. When summed at the input, they largely cancel each other out.23  
2. **Reduced EMI Filter Size:** This cancellation of the fundamental ripple component at the source drastically reduces the conducted differential-mode noise. This allows for a significantly smaller, lighter, and less-expensive input EMI filter (specifically the DM choke).10  
3. **Smaller Boost Inductors:** Each phase processes only half the total power ($P\_{out}/2$), enabling the use of two smaller magnetic components rather than one massive one.25  
4. **Reduced DC Link Capacitor Stress:** The output ripple currents (which are discontinuous) also partially cancel. This *greatly reduces* the high-frequency RMS current that the $C\_{bulk}$ capacitor must handle.25 This reduction in RMS current stress is critical, as it lowers the capacitor's internal I²R heating and directly improves system reliability and lifetime.29  
5. **Thermal Spreading:** Power dissipation is distributed across two sets of switches, diodes, and inductors, simplifying thermal management and improving thermal reliability.10

## **Section 2: Design and Sizing of the Main Boost Inductor (Energy Transfer)**

### **2.1 Fundamental Inductor Design Equation (CCM)**

The main boost inductor ($L\_{boost}$) value is a primary design tradeoff. A smaller inductance value is cheaper and smaller but results in higher ripple current. This increases peak current stress on the components and conduction losses, and risks the converter falling into Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) at light loads.10 A large inductance is bulky, expensive, and has higher DC resistance (DCR), which increases conduction losses.25

The design process begins by setting a target for the peak-to-peak inductor current ripple ($\\Delta i\_{L}$) at the worst-case operating point: the peak of the sine wave at minimum AC input voltage (low line). As noted, a typical target for CCM is **20% to 40%** of the peak inductor current.18

The required inductance can be calculated from the fundamental inductor equation ($V \= L \\cdot di/dt$). An authoritative design formula for a *single-phase* CCM PFC, derived from this principle, is provided by Infineon 19:

$$L \= \\frac{1}{\\%Ripple} \\cdot \\frac{V\_{ac,min}^2}{P\_o} \\cdot \\left(1 \- \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot V\_{ac,min}}{V\_o}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{f\_{sw}}$$  
Where:

* $\\%Ripple$: Target ripple (e.g., 0.25 for 25%)  
* $V\_{ac,min}$: Minimum RMS input voltage (e.g., 85 VAC)  
* $P\_o$: Total output power  
* $V\_o$: DC output voltage (e.g., 400 VDC)  
* $f\_{sw}$: Switching frequency

### **2.2 Design Example: 1.2kW Single-Phase (for baseline)**

Using the formula above with parameters from an Infineon 1.2 kW reference design provides a concrete baseline value 19:

* $P\_o$ \= 1200 W  
* $V\_{ac,min}$ \= 85 VAC  
* $V\_o$ \= 400 VDC  
* $f\_{sw}$ \= 100 kHz  
* $\\%Ripple$ \= 0.25 (25%)

$$L \= \\frac{1}{0.25} \\cdot \\frac{(85)^2}{1200} \\cdot \\left(1 \- \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 85}{400}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{100 \\times 10^3} \= 168.5 \\mu H$$  
This calculation demonstrates that for high-power, high-frequency operation, the main boost inductor is in the range of hundreds of microhenries, not millihenries or henries.

### **2.3 Adjusting for Interleaved Topology (N=2 phases)**

When implementing a two-phase interleaved design, each inductor processes half the total power ($P\_o/2$). The designer can either halve the switching frequency 25 or, more commonly, design two smaller inductors based on the per-phase power.25

Comparing reference designs shows this scaling:

* **1.2 kW (Single-Phase):** 168.5 $\\mu$H 19  
* **650 W (Single-Phase):** 598 $\\mu$H (calculated) 30  
* **500 W (Two-Phase Interleaved):** 2x 150 $\\mu$H (per phase) 31

This confirms that the *per-phase* inductance for a 500W-2kW interleaved system (processing 250W-1kW per phase) remains in a consistent range.

### **2.4 Typical Values and Magnetic Core Selection**

**Typical Value Range:** Based on the analysis, for 500W-2kW interleaved CCM converters operating at typical frequencies (65 kHz – 150 kHz), the main boost inductors ($L\_{boost}$) are in the range of **150 $\\mu$H to 600 $\\mu$H** per phase.

**Magnetic Core Selection:** The inductor must support a very high DC bias current (at the peak of the low-line AC input) without saturating. Standard ferrite cores are unsuitable for this. The industry standard is to use **powder cores** (which have a distributed air gap), such as **Kool M$\\mu$** (a sendust alloy).19

These cores exhibit a highly desirable non-linear property: their inductance "swings" (decreases) as the DC bias current increases.19 This "swinging choke" characteristic is exploited by designers:

* **At full load (high current):** The inductance drops to its target design value (e.g., 165 $\\mu$H).19  
* **At light load (low current):** The inductance is much higher (e.g., 680 $\\mu$H).19 This higher inductance helps the converter remain in CCM, improving light-load efficiency and power factor.

## **Section 3: Sizing the DC Link Capacitor (Bulk Energy Storage)**

### **3.1 Primary Functions of the DC Link Capacitor**

The DC link capacitor ($C\_{bulk}$) is the high-voltage (typically 400 V or 450 V rated) aluminum electrolytic capacitor at the output of the PFC stage.10 Its value is determined by two main constraints, and the final capacitance *must* be the larger of the two resulting calculations.16

1. **Holdup Time ($t\_{holdup}$):** The ability to supply power to the downstream DC-DC converter during an AC line dropout (e.g., one or two line cycles, 16-20 ms).10  
2. **Low-Frequency Ripple Buffering:** The need to absorb the large power pulsation that occurs at twice the line frequency (100 Hz/120 Hz).17

For server, telecom, and industrial power supplies, the **holdup time requirement almost always dictates the minimum capacitance value**.10

### **3.2 Sizing Constraint 1: Holdup Time ($t\_{holdup}$)**

This calculation determines the capacitance needed to supply the full output power ($P\_{out}$) for the required holdup time ($t\_{holdup}$) as the capacitor voltage drops from its nominal value ($V\_{initial}$) to the minimum input voltage ($V\_{final}$) tolerated by the downstream converter.

An authoritative equation from Texas Instruments for this calculation is 16:

$$C\_{holdup} \= \\frac{2 \\cdot P\_{out} \\cdot t\_{holdup}}{V\_{initial}^2 \- V\_{final}^2}$$  
**Design Example (1kW):**

* $P\_{out}$ \= 1000 W  
* $t\_{holdup}$ \= 16 ms (a typical specification 10)  
* $V\_{initial}$ \= 400 V (nominal DC link voltage)  
* $V\_{final}$ \= 300 V (typical minimum input for a downstream LLC converter)

$$C\_{holdup} \= \\frac{2 \\cdot 1000 \\cdot 0.016}{400^2 \- 300^2} \= \\frac{32}{160,000 \- 90,000} \= \\frac{32}{70,000} \= 457 \\mu F$$

### **3.3 Sizing Constraint 2: Low-Frequency (100/120Hz) Voltage Ripple**

If holdup time is not a concern, the capacitor is sized to limit the peak-to-peak voltage ripple ($V\_{ripple,pp}$) caused by the 100/120Hz power pulsation.

A common equation for this calculation is 16:

$$C\_{ripple} \= \\frac{I\_{out}}{V\_{ripple,pp} \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\omega\_{line}} \= \\frac{P\_{out} / V\_o}{V\_{ripple,pp} \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot f\_{line}}$$  
**Design Example (1kW):**

* $P\_{out} / V\_o$ \= 1000 W / 400 V \= 2.5 A  
* $V\_{ripple,pp}$ \= 20 V (a typical allowable ripple 10)  
* $f\_{line}$ \= 50 Hz

$$C\_{ripple} \= \\frac{2.5}{20 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\pi \\cdot 50} \= \\frac{2.5}{12,566} \= 199 \\mu F$$  
**Conclusion:** The holdup requirement (457 $\\mu$F) is more than double the ripple requirement (199 $\\mu$F). The designer must therefore select the larger value. A standard 450 V electrolytic capacitor of **470 $\\mu$F** or **560 $\\mu$F** would be chosen.

### **3.4 Typical Capacitance Values and Ripple Current Rating**

**Typical Value Range:**

* A 500 W reference design (TIDA-010015) uses **220 $\\mu$F**.8  
* An onsemi reference design bill of materials specifies **2x 330 $\\mu$F (660 $\\mu$F total)**.10  
* Our 1 kW calculation yielded **\~470 $\\mu$F**.

This confirms a typical range of **220 $\\mu$F to 700 $\\mu$F** for 500W-2kW systems, almost exclusively 450V-rated aluminum electrolytic types.

**Ripple Current Rating:** The capacitor's lifetime is critically dependent on its ability to handle the RMS ripple current.33 This current is a composite of a large low-frequency (100/120Hz) component and a high-frequency (switching frequency) component.16 As established in Section 1.3, interleaving drastically reduces the high-frequency component, lowering the total RMS current, which in turn reduces the capacitor's internal $I^2R$ heating and significantly enhances system reliability and lifespan.25

## **Section 4: Component Design for the Input EMI Filter Stage**

### **4.1 Overview of EMI Filter Function and Modes**

The high-frequency switching of the PFC stage is a significant source of both differential-mode and common-mode EMI noise.35 The input EMI filter is a multi-stage, passive low-pass filter designed to attenuate this conducted noise to meet regulatory standards like CISPR 11 or CISPR 32 Class B.37

The filter is designed to attack two noise propagation modes 11:

1. **Differential-Mode (DM) Noise:** Noise current circulating between Line and Neutral. It is attenuated by **Class-X capacitors** and **DM chokes**.  
2. **Common-Mode (CM) Noise:** Noise current flowing in the same direction on both Line and Neutral, returning via the safety Earth Ground. It is attenuated by **Class-Y capacitors** and **CM chokes**.

### **4.2 Class-X Capacitors (Noise Filtering)**

* **Role:** These capacitors are placed "across the line" (Line-to-Neutral).14 They provide a low-impedance path to shunt high-frequency DM noise from the line to the neutral.41  
* **Safety Rating:** They must be safety-certified as **Class-X** per the IEC 60384-14 standard.15  
* **Safety Failure Mode:** Class-X capacitors are explicitly *designed to fail in a short-circuit* condition.14 This is a critical safety feature. A short-circuit failure will immediately draw excessive current, *guaranteeing* that the upstream fuse or circuit breaker trips. This safely disconnects the equipment from the hazardous AC voltage and prevents a fire.14  
* **Typical Values:**  
  * Texas Instruments 1 kW reference design (TIDA-00707): **0.68 $\\mu$F**.21  
  * onsemi reference design: **680 nF (0.68 $\\mu$F)**.10  
  * The typical range for 500W-2kW systems is **0.47 $\\mu$F to 1.0 $\\mu$F**, often implemented with multiple smaller film capacitors in parallel.

### **4.3 Class-Y Capacitors (Noise Filtering)**

* **Role:** These capacitors are placed from Line-to-Ground and Neutral-to-Ground.14 They shunt high-frequency CM noise to the safety earth ground.15  
* **Safety Rating:** They must be certified as **Class-Y**.15  
* **Safety Failure Mode:** In direct contrast to X-caps, Class-Y capacitors are *designed to fail in an open-circuit* condition.14 This is an essential safety measure. If a Y-capacitor were to fail short, it would connect the live AC line directly to the equipment's metal chassis (ground), creating a lethal electric shock hazard.14  
* **Key Design Constraint:** The total capacitance of Y-capacitors is *strictly limited* by safety standards (e.g., IEC 62368-1) to control the ground leakage current. This limit (often \< 1 mA) forces their capacitance to be very small.43  
* **Typical Values:**  
  * onsemi reference design: **4.7 nF**.10  
  * Due to the leakage current constraint, the typical range is almost always **1.0 nF to 4.7 nF**.

### **4.4 Differential-Mode (DM) Chokes (Input Filtering)**

* **Role:** This is an inductor placed in series with the line to present a high impedance to DM noise, working with the X-capacitors to form a low-pass LC filter.10  
* **Core:** The DM choke must be able to handle the full RMS line current (e.g., $1000W / 85V \= 11.7A$) at full load without saturating. This typically requires powder cores or gapped ferrites.  
* **Typical Values:**  
  * Texas Instruments 500 W interleaved design (TIDA-010015) schematic: Two DM chokes (L3, L5) are specified at **1 mH (1000 $\\mu$H)** each.31  
  * The typical range is from **100s of $\\mu$H to low mH**.  
* **Interleaving Benefit:** As established, interleaving cancels the fundamental switching ripple.25 This means the DM choke only needs to filter higher-order harmonics, allowing for a *much smaller* inductance value than would be required for a single-phase converter of the same power, saving significant cost, weight, and board space.24

### **4.5 Common-Mode (CM) Chokes (Input Filtering)**

* **Role:** A CM choke consists of two windings (one for Line, one for Neutral) on a *single* toroidal core.11  
* **Principle of Operation:** The component's operation is based on flux cancellation.  
  * **For Differential-Mode current (normal operation):** The load current flows *in* on the line and *out* on the neutral. These equal and opposite currents create opposing magnetic fluxes in the core, which *cancel each other out*.11 The choke is thus "invisible" to the normal load current and will not saturate.  
  * **For Common-Mode noise:** The noise currents flow in the *same direction* on both lines. Their magnetic fluxes *add together*, creating a very high impedance that effectively blocks the noise from reaching the AC line.11  
* **Core:** Because the load current flux is self-cancelling, designers can use high-permeability, high-inductance **ferrite toroid** cores to achieve very high impedance at the noise frequencies.44  
* **Typical Values:** To be effective at attenuating noise in the 150 kHz to 30 MHz band, CM chokes require high inductance, typically in the range of **1 mH to 10 mH**.

## **Section 5: Reference Design Summary and Concluding Analysis**

### **5.1 Table 1: Summary of Typical Passive Component Values for 500W-2kW PFC Converters**

The table below synthesizes the analysis and provides the typical component values requested, mapped to the query's terminology.

| Component Function (User Query) | Standard Component Name & Topology | Typical Value Range | Key Design Driver(s) | Authoritative Source / Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Inductor:** "Energy Transfer" (not Output Filtering) | **Main Boost Inductor ($L\_{boost}$)** (Interleaved CCM, per phase) | **150 $\\mu$H – 600 $\\mu$H** | 20-40% ripple current at low line; Switching Frequency ($f\_{sw}$) | 19 |
| **Inductor:** "Input Filtering" | **Differential-Mode (DM) Choke** (EMI Filter Stage) | **100 $\\mu$H – 1 mH** (1000 $\\mu$H) | Attenuation at $f\_{sw}$; must not saturate at peak line current | 10 |
| **Inductor:** "Input Filtering" | **Common-Mode (CM) Choke** (EMI Filter Stage) | **1 mH – 10 mH** | High attenuation at $f\_{sw}$; flux-cancelling (will not saturate) | 11 |
| **Capacitor:** "DC Link" (Energy Storage) | **Bulk Capacitor ($C\_{bulk}$)** (DC Output, 400-450V) | **220 $\\mu$F – 700 $\\mu$F** | **Holdup Time** (e.g., 16ms); 100/120Hz power ripple | 8 |
| **Capacitor:** "Energy Transfer" (Noise Filtering) | **Class-X Safety Capacitor** (EMI Filter, Line-to-Neutral) | **0.47 $\\mu$F – 1.0 $\\mu$F** (275-310VAC) | DM noise attenuation; safety (fail-short) | 10 |
| **Capacitor:** "Energy Transfer" (Noise Filtering) | **Class-Y Safety Capacitor** (EMI Filter, Line-to-Ground) | **1.0 nF – 4.7 nF** (275VAC) | CM noise attenuation; **Leakage Current Limit**; safety (fail-open) | 10 |

### **5.2 Impact of Wide-Bandgap (SiC/GaN) Devices on Passive Components**

The preceding analysis is based on traditional Silicon (Si) MOSFETs, which are typically limited by switching losses to frequencies of **65 kHz to 120 kHz**.45 The fundamental design equations for inductors and capacitors show that the required size of these passive components is *inversely proportional* to the switching frequency.19

The commercialization of Wide-Bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, namely Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN), is fundamentally altering these design tradeoffs. WBG devices exhibit dramatically lower switching losses and parasitic capacitances than silicon.45 This lower loss enables designers to increase the switching frequency significantly—to **140 kHz \- 250 kHz** for SiC 46 and in excess of 1 MHz for GaN.48

This increase in switching frequency directly enables the use of **smaller, lighter, and lower-cost passive components (inductors and capacitors)**, driving a new generation of high-density power supplies.45

Furthermore, WBG devices enable entirely new topologies that were impractical with silicon. The **Bridgeless Totem-Pole PFC** is the preeminent example.26 This topology removes the input diode bridge, eliminating its significant conduction losses (a \~2% efficiency gain).10 A GaN-based totem-pole PFC can achieve peak efficiencies greater than 99% 53 and, combined with its high-frequency operation, represents the future of high-power-density (e.g., 155 W/in³) conversion in the 500W-2kW range.45
