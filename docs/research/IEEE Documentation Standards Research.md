# **An Analysis of IEEE Standards for Power Electronics Documentation, Notational Consistency, and Technical Accuracy**

## **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the IEEE standards and best practices governing technical documentation, with a specific focus on power electronics. The findings demonstrate that technical accuracy in documentation is not a passive task of "writing" or "proofreading," but an active, rigorous engineering discipline. This discipline is governed by a suite of interconnected IEEE standards that define the required technical content, the formal language of notation, and the quality assurance processes necessary to ensure and maintain accuracy.

The analysis is structured in three parts. First, it examines the IEEE recommended practices for power electronics, establishing that core design standards—such as IEEE 1662-2023 and IEEE 1573-2021—are not "documentation standards" *per se*, but rather *design and application standards* that implicitly mandate a robust documentation suite as the primary evidence of compliance. This documentation is shown to be a critical component for ensuring system reliability, interoperability, and safety.

Second, the report details the foundational language of engineering: mathematical and notational standards, centered on IEEE Standard 280\. It deconstructs the principles of notational precision, such as the critical distinction between *italicized quantity symbols* (e.g., *V*) and *roman unit symbols* (e.g., V), which forms the unambiguous "grammar" of engineering. This section demonstrates that IEEE 280, in conjunction with IEEE 260.1 (Units) and 260.3 (Signs), creates a complete notational ecosystem essential for interoperability.

Finally, this report establishes a process-based framework for achieving and maintaining technical accuracy, as requested by the query. By applying the principles of IEEE 1012 (Verification and Validation) and IEEE 828 (Configuration Management) directly to documentation, an organization can treat its technical manuals as managed, controlled, and verified assets, identical in importance to the hardware and software they describe. This framework, bounded by the legal and safety requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC®), transforms documentation from a liability into the primary auditable record of engineering diligence.

## **Part 1: Documentation Mandates in Power Electronics Design and Application**

The primary IEEE standards for power electronics do not exist as standalone "documentation guides." Instead, they are system-level design and application standards that create a framework of required technical content. The documentation, therefore, becomes the essential artifact that proves compliance with these recommended practices and provides the criteria for reliable operation.

### **1.1 The System-Level Framework: IEEE 1662-2023**

The highest-level standard governing this domain is **IEEE 1662-2023: IEEE Recommended Practice for the Design and Application of Power Electronics in Electrical Power Systems**.1 This standard provides recommendations for large-scale power electronics equipment, defined as having "aggregated power ratings at and above 100 kW with voltages equal or less than 52 kV (ac) or (dc)".3

The critical implication for documentation stems directly from the standard's abstract. It mandates that "Existing engineering practices, analytical methods, and performance characteristics are described".3 Furthermore, it requires the provision of "appropriate guidance to provide users... with correct criteria for design, testing, and maintenance necessary for reliable operation of integrated power systems".3

This language effectively mandates a comprehensive documentation suite as the primary evidence of compliance. To demonstrate adherence to this recommended practice, an engineer or organization must *produce* the documents that "describe" the "analytical methods" used and the "performance characteristics" verified. The required documentation—such as design reports, test plans, and maintenance procedures—is thus defined by the standard's content. The focus on "reliable operation" elevates this documentation from a simple deliverable to a critical system component. An inaccurate or incomplete maintenance manual is not merely a documentation error; it is a direct threat to the reliable operation of the integrated power system.

### **1.2 The Subsystem-Level Framework: IEEE 1573-2021**

Operating at a more granular level is **IEEE 1573-2021: IEEE Recommended Practice for Electronic Power Subsystems: Parameters, Interfaces, Elements and Performance**.1 This standard targets "electronic systems engineers and integrators" as well as "power element manufacturers and suppliers".1 It covers subsystems with a voltage range of 600 V and below and power levels up to 20 kW.1

The title of this standard provides a *prescriptive structure* for technical documentation, particularly datasheets and specifications. It explicitly "addresses system-level issues in element or subsystem integration" and "defines system interface parameters, test methods, and test conditions".1

If IEEE 1662 defines the system philosophy, IEEE 1573 defines the *technical contract* for integration. The audience—engineers, integrators, and suppliers 7—highlights that its purpose is to ensure components from different manufacturers can be integrated successfully. This integration is only possible if the documentation is complete and unambiguous. Therefore, this standard dictates that a compliant datasheet for a power electronics subsystem must be structured around these four pillars:

1. **Parameters:** The fundamental characteristics of the device.  
2. **Interfaces:** The defined connection points (electrical, mechanical, data) and their explicit parameters.  
3. **Elements:** Descriptions of the subsystem's components.  
4. **Performance:** The measured operational characteristics, defined under the specific "test methods and test conditions".1

A document that fails to define all four of these, especially the interfaces and test conditions, is non-compliant with this recommended practice and represents a significant source of integration risk.

### **1.3 Practical Documentation: Schematics, Safety, and Context**

The technical content mandated by IEEE 1662 and 1573 is primarily communicated through graphical representations and must exist within a non-negotiable safety framework.

**Schematics:** Schematics are the primary "graphical representation" used for "installation, testing, and maintenance".9 A paper addressing schematic representation within the IEEE PSRC (Power System Relaying Committee) highlights a crucial best practice: schematics must "emphasize the functional arrangement as opposed to the physical arrangement." This functional emphasis "facilitates an understanding of how the system is supposed to operate" and simplifies functional testing.9 This principle creates a direct link to the standards: the "maintenance criteria" from IEEE 1662 and the "interface parameters" from IEEE 1573 are rendered actionable *only* when they are mapped to a clear, functional schematic that illustrates operational logic, not just a physical wiring diagram.

**Safety Context (NESC):** The design and documentation of power electronics systems (especially those falling under IEEE 1662\) are bounded by the **National Electrical Safety Code® (NESC®)**.10 Published by IEEE, the NESC provides the "minimum requirements for the safe installation, operation, and maintenance of power and communications utility systems".1 It is crucial to distinguish this from the National Electrical Code® (NEC®), which applies to non-utility, premises wiring.10

The NESC acts as the overarching legal and safety boundary for the technical documentation. A maintenance procedure developed in accordance with IEEE 1662 could be technically brilliant but simultaneously violate NESC safety rules, placing personnel at risk. Therefore, a best practice for technical accuracy *must* include a formal review of all installation, operation, and maintenance documentation for compliance with NESC requirements.

## **Part 2: The Foundational Language of Engineering: Mathematical and Notational Standards**

Technical accuracy is impossible if the fundamental language of engineering—mathematical notation—is ambiguous. The IEEE provides a rigid framework for this language, centered on IEEE Standard 280, to ensure that all documentation is precise and universally intelligible.

### **2.1 The Cornerstone Standard: IEEE 280**

**IEEE 280-1985 (R2003): IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Quantities Used in Electrical Science and Electrical Engineering** is the cornerstone of this framework.12 The fundamental principle of this standard is that it provides letter symbols for *physical quantities* (the concepts themselves), and these symbols are "independent of the units" used to measure them.13 This standard was developed to be compatible with international standards, specifically IEC Publication 27\.15

The principle of separating the *quantity* (the physical idea) from the *unit* (the measurement scale) is the most critical concept for eliminating ambiguity in technical documentation. A common error in non-standardized documentation is to conflate the two; for example, writing "V \= 5V". This is notationally nonsensical, as it mixes the quantity symbol *V* with the unit symbol V. The correct, unambiguous notation, as mandated by IEEE standards, is *V* \= 5 V.

IEEE 280 is, therefore, a risk-mitigation standard. In its absence, organizations and teams develop their own "internal dialects" (e.g., using *V\_S*, *V\_{in}*, or *E\_S* for supply voltage). This creates a high risk of misinterpretation, particularly when integrating subsystems from different suppliers (the exact problem IEEE 1573 addresses). Adopting IEEE 280 makes all documentation—internal, external, and from suppliers—mutually intelligible, thus reducing integration errors.

### **2.2 Prescriptive Notational Rules and Examples**

The *IEEE SA Standards Style Manual* and IEEE 280 itself provide the practical, typographical rules for implementing this notational separation.15

**Typographical Mandates:**

* **Quantities/Variables:** All quantity symbols are to be set in *italic* type (e.g., *l, m, t, P, V, I*).15  
* **Units/Abbreviations:** All unit symbols, function names, and word abbreviations are to be set in *roman* (upright) type.  
  * Units: e.g., m, s, W, V, A, Hz.15  
  * Functions: e.g., sin, cos, exp.16  
  * Abbreviations: e.g., max, min, in, out.16

Equation Presentation Rules:  
The IEEE SA Standards Style Manual provides further best practices for presenting equations 16:

* A multiplication sign ($\\times$) must be used for the multiplication of values, not the letter 'x' or a multidot ($\\cdot$) (e.g., 3 cm $\\times$ 4 cm).  
* Equations of key importance should be numbered consecutively.  
* Equations must be cited in the text by name (e.g., "see Equation (1)").  
* All terms in an equation "shall be defined in a tabulation following the equation," preceded by the word *where*.

Authoritative Letter Symbols for Quantities (IEEE 280):  
IEEE 280-1985 (R2003) provides an extensive list of standardized quantity symbols. The following table, derived from Table 5, "Fields and Circuits," in the standard, provides key examples.15

| Quantity | Quantity Symbol(s) | Unit (SI) | Unit Symbol |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| electric charge | *Q* | coulomb | C |
| surface density of charge | *\\sigma* | coulomb per square meter | C/m² |
| volume density of charge | *\\rho* | coulomb per cubic meter | C/m³ |
| electric field strength | *E, K* | volt per meter | V/m |
| voltage (electromotive force) | *V, E, U* | volt | V |
| electric flux | *\\Psi* | coulomb | C |
| electric flux density | *D* | coulomb per square meter | C/m² |
| capacitivity (permittivity) | *\\epsilon* | farad per meter | F/m |
| relative capacitivity | *\\epsilon\_r, k* | (numeric) | \- |
| (electric) current | *I* | ampere | A |
| current density | *J, S* | ampere per square meter | A/m² |
| magnetic field strength | *H* | ampere per meter | A/m |
| magnetomotive force | *F, F\_m, \\mathfrak{F}* | ampere | A |
| magnetic flux | *\\Phi* | weber | Wb |

The allowance of multiple symbols for the same quantity (e.g., *V, E, U* for voltage) acknowledges different historical conventions (e.g., $E$ for electromotive force vs. $V$ for potential difference). The standard states, "a quantity symbol should be used throughout a given work for the same physical quantity".15 This implies a two-level compliance model:

1. **IEEE Compliance:** Use a symbol from the approved list in IEEE 280\.  
2. **Organizational Best Practice:** The organization's internal style guide must select *one* of the approved symbols (e.g., "This organization shall use *V* for voltage") and enforce it for all internal documentation to ensure absolute consistency.

### **2.3 The Complete Notational Ecosystem**

IEEE 280 does not exist in isolation. It is part of a "trinity" of notational standards that together define the complete language.16

1. **IEEE Std 280:** Defines the *quantity symbols* (the italicized variables like *P* or *V*).  
2. **IEEE Std 260.1™:** "IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Units of Measurement (SI Units, Customary Inch-)".16 This standardizes the *unit symbols* (the roman symbols like W or V).  
3. **ANSI/IEEE Std 260.3™:** "American National Standard for Mathematical Signs and Symbols for Use in Physical Sciences and Technology".16 This standardizes the *operators* (e.g., \=, \+, $\\times$, $\\nabla$).

Full compliance with engineering best practices requires adherence to this complete ecosystem. A simple, accurate statement like "$P \= V \\times I$" is only fully compliant when the symbols for quantities ($P, V, I$), the mathematical signs (=, $\\times$), and the corresponding unit symbols (W, V, A) are all used in accordance with their respective standards.

## **Part 3: A Process-Based Framework for Ensuring Technical Accuracy**

Technical accuracy is not a static state achieved by a single proofread. It is a continuous process of quality assurance. Best practices for engineering documentation dictate that the documentation itself must be treated as a critical product component, subject to the same formal engineering processes as hardware and software.

### **3.1 The Global Standard for Technical Instructions: IEC/IEEE 82079-1**

The "primary standard for all technical writers" is **IEC/IEEE 82079-1 (2019)**.17 This standard supersedes older standards (like DIN EN 62079:2001) and provides a comprehensive framework for "creating instructions for all types of product".17

Most significantly, this standard "defines the qualifications that technical writers need to have".17 This professionalizes the role of the technical writer, elevating it from a "scribe" to a qualified professional responsible for user-facing safety, usability, and compliance. This implies that an organization, to be compliant with best practices, cannot assign documentation to an untrained resource. It must use personnel who meet the qualifications defined in the standard, which include expertise in the subject matter, the documentation process, and linguistic standards.

### **3.2 Verification and Validation (V\&V) as a Documentation Process**

The core process for *achieving* technical accuracy is Verification and Validation (V\&V). While often associated with software, **IEEE Standard 1012** (Standard for System, Software, and Hardware Verification and Validation) explicitly includes documentation within its scope. The standard states that its V\&V processes apply to "systems, software, and hardware," and that "each of the terms system, software, and hardware includes **documentation**".18

This is a critical distinction. It means documentation must undergo the same rigorous V\&V as the code it describes, including "analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing".18 This moves far beyond simple proofreading.

* **Analysis:** Does the procedure described in the manual align with the system's design (IEEE 1662\) and interface specifications (IEEE 1573)?  
* **Review/Inspection:** Does the document adhere to all notational standards (IEEE 280\) and safety standards (NESC)?  
* **Testing:** Can a qualified technician (per IEC/IEEE 82079-1) *successfully and safely* perform the documented maintenance procedure using *only* the draft documentation? This is the literal "testing" of the document.

A practical checklist for this V\&V process can be derived from the IEEE's academic peer review criteria.20 A formal internal documentation review should assess:

1. **Validity:** Is the procedure or study described technically sound and well-designed?  
2. **Data:** Are all technical data—such as the *Parameters* (from 1573\) and *Performance Characteristics* (from 1662)—factually correct and properly analyzed?  
3. **Clarity:** Are the ideas expressed logically and unambiguously for the target audience?  
4. **Compliance:** Does the document meet all ethical, legal, and standards requirements (e.g., NESC, IEEE 280)?

### **3.3 Configuration Management (CM) for Documentation Integrity**

If V\&V ensures a document is *initially* correct, Configuration Management (CM) ensures it *stays* correct over the product's lifecycle. **IEEE 828-2012: Standard for Configuration Management in Systems and Software Engineering** provides the process for this.22

The purpose of CM is to: a) **Identify** characteristics, b) **Control** changes, c) **Record and report** status, and d) **Support the audit** of products to verify conformance.24 This process is explicitly applied to the "**technical baseline documentation**".25

This framework prevents the dangerous desynchronization of a product and its documentation. When a power electronic subsystem's firmware is updated, the CM process *must* trigger a formal change request against the associated documentation. The documentation (e.g., user manual, maintenance guide) is then updated, subjected to the *full V\&V process* (per IEEE 1012\) to validate the changes, and then "re-baselined" as the new official version.

This transforms documentation from a collection of files into a formal, controlled engineering asset. This means all key documentation must be subject to:

1. **Identification:** Unique part numbers and versioning (e.g., Manual\_v2.1\_PN\_900-101).  
2. **Control:** No changes are permitted without a formal, approved Engineering Change Order (ECO).  
3. **Reporting:** A clear version history (revision block) detailing *what* changed, *why* it changed, and *who* approved it.  
4. **Audit:** A periodic check to ensure the documentation for the *as-shipped* product matches the *as-built* product's hardware/firmware revision.

### **3.4 Citation, Ethics, and Authority**

Finally, the entire framework rests on a principle of authority and liability. Documentation must provide "the authority to back up your ideas" and give "appropriate credit".26 IEEE also has strict ethical policies against plagiarism and improper "prior publication".27

Critically, the IEEE itself "does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information or the soundness of any judgments contained in its standards".28 The use of an IEEE standard is "wholly voluntary".28 This disclaimer places the *full and total burden of liability for accuracy* onto the *organization implementing the standard*.

An organization cannot use "we followed IEEE 1662" as a legal defense if a system fails. The only defense is to *prove* that the standard was implemented *correctly* and that all documented information is accurate.30 That proof *is* the body of records generated by the internal V\&V (1012) and CM (828) processes.

In this context, "citation" 26 takes on a new meaning. It is not just academic citation, but *internal traceability*. A "performance characteristic" (from 1662\) stated in a user manual must be traceable—or "citable"—back to its source of authority: a specific V\&V test report, an approved engineering analysis, or a requirement from a safety standard like NESC. This internal traceability is what allows an auditor (per IEEE 828\) to "verify conformance to requirements".24

## **Part 4: Synthesis and Actionable Recommendations**

### **4.1 The Unified Documentation Framework**

The analysis reveals that documentation for power electronics is an interdependent, three-part framework. A failure in any one part results in a total failure of the documentation.

1. **Content (Part 1):** The *technical substance* of what must be documented, as defined by **IEEE 1662** (system criteria) and **IEEE 1573** (subsystem parameters/interfaces).  
2. **Language (Part 2):** The *formal notation* used to express the content unambiguously, as defined by the **IEEE 280/260** "trinity."  
3. **Process (Part 3):** The *quality assurance lifecycle* that ensures the content is and remains accurate, as defined by **IEC/IEEE 82079-1** (qualifications), **IEEE 1012** (V\&V), and **IEEE 828** (CM).

Correct technical content (Part 1\) written in ambiguous notation (a Part 2 failure) can lead to misapplication. Accurate and clear content (Parts 1 & 2\) that is out-of-date due to a firmware change (a Part 3 failure) is dangerously misleading. All three pillars must be robust.

### **4.2 Prescriptive Recommendations for Implementation**

To implement this unified framework, an organization should take the following prescriptive steps:

1. **Establish a Formal Documentation Governance Charter:** Based on **IEC/IEEE 82079-1** 17, formally define the role, responsibilities, and required *qualifications* of the technical documentation team. This charter should grant them the authority to participate in design reviews and V\&V testing.  
2. **Create a Unified Organizational Style & Notation Guide:** This guide must mandate adherence to the "notational trinity": **IEEE 280** (quantities), **IEEE 260.1** (units), and **IEEE 260.3** (signs).16 It must enforce all typographical rules (italic vs. roman) 16 and *resolve all ambiguities* by selecting a single, standard symbol from the approved IEEE 280 list for internal use (e.g., "$V$" for all voltage).  
3. **Develop Content Templates Based on IEEE 1662 and 1573:**  
   * All system-level design and maintenance documents must be templated to include sections addressing the "design, testing, and maintenance criteria" from **IEEE 1662**.3  
   * All component datasheets and specifications *must* be structured around the four pillars of **IEEE 1573**: **Parameters, Interfaces, Elements, and Performance**.1  
4. **Implement a Formal V\&V and CM Documentation Lifecycle:**  
   * **A. Create:** Author content using the approved Style Guide (Rec 2\) and Content Templates (Rec 3).  
   * **B. V\&V:** Subject all drafts to a formal "Documentation Peer Review" based on the **IEEE 1012** process 18 and the review checklist (Validity, Data, Clarity, Compliance).20 This must include "testing" the document.  
   * **C. Baseline:** Upon V\&V approval, the document is formally baselined as a "technical baseline document" 25 and placed under the control of the **IEEE 828** Configuration Management process.  
   * **D. Maintain:** No change to associated hardware or software is considered "complete" until the corresponding change to the baselined documentation has been requested, implemented, *re-verified* (Step B), and re-baselined.  
5. **Integrate Safety and Legal Compliance:**  
   * All installation, operation, and maintenance documentation must include a formal review gate for compliance with the **National Electrical Safety Code (NESC®)**.10  
   * The organization must acknowledge the legal liability principle 28 and treat the documentation and the V\&V/CM records (from Rec 4\) as the primary legal record of engineering diligence and accuracy.

### **4.3 Concluding Analysis**

By adopting this integrated framework, an organization transforms its technical documentation from a passive, expensive "afterthought" into an active, high-value engineering asset. This approach treats documentation as a product to be designed, tested, and managed with the same rigor as the system it describes. The resulting documentation asset actively mitigates integration risk, ensures compliance with technical and safety standards, and provides a single, verifiable, and unambiguous source of technical truth for all stakeholders, from internal engineers to external integrators and end-users.
