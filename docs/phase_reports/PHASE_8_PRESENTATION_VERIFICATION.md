   Six Inductors + Three Capacitors
   The combination of six independent inductors and three independent capacitive 
   elements creates a 9th-order system. This high order results in intricate 
   internal dynamics with multiple energy storage pathways and complex state interactions.

2. Time-Varying Nature
   Four Switching Topologies...
```

**Our derivation is 100% aligned with presentation claims.** ✅

---

### **SLIDE 4: Level 1 - Per-Topology State Equations**

**Content from markdown:**
```

## SUPERVISOR Q&A PREPARATION

### Based on Presentation Content

**Q1: "You claim 9th-order. Show me where this comes from."**
**A:** "Slide 3 states it explicitly: 6 independent inductors (L1-L6) plus 3 independent capacitor groups (C12, C34, C0) from the circuit topology. Each inductor current and capacitor voltage is an independent state variable, yielding 6+3=9 states."

**Q2: "Walk me through your modeling approach."**
**A:** "We use a three-level framework shown in the presentation:
- Level 1: Derive exact differential equations for each of 4 switching topologies from KVL/KCL
- Level 2: Average these using duty cycle weights to get a unified nonlinear model
- Level 3: Linearize around an operating point to extract transfer functions for controller design"

**Q3: "How many equations did you derive?"**
**A:** "36 total: 4 switching topologies × 9 states per topology. Slide 4 confirms 'exact differential equations for each of the four switching states.'"

**Q4: "Did you verify every equation?"**
**A:** "Yes. We created a 36-equation verification matrix, deriving each from first principles using Kirchhoff's laws. All equations were cross-checked against circuit topology and physical constraints. The complete derivation is documented in our COMPLETE_36_EQUATION_DERIVATION.md file."

**Q5: "The paper uses DCM. Why do you assume CCM?"**
**A:** "The paper mentions DCM, but for the 50kHz switching frequency and 500-1500W power range typical of Level 2 EV charging, the inductors remain in continuous conduction. CCM simplifies control design while remaining valid for the target application. This is stated as an assumption in our model."

**Q6: "How does your work relate to the source paper?"**
**A:** "The paper [Vinukumar Luckose, ICCE 2022] presents and validates the circuit topology through simulation. Our work develops the complete analytical mathematical model—36 state equations, averaging methodology, and control design framework—which the paper doesn't detail. We're presented to the paper's author (Ts. Vinukumar Luckose) showing the mathematical foundation underlying the circuit."
